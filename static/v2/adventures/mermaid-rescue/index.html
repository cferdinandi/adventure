	<ul class="list-spaced"><li>The old man by the sea is actually a merfolk wizard who will reward adventurers with a special gift if they go on his side-adventure and retrieve the magical hook. Don&rsquo;t reveal this until the end.</li><li>If adventurers don&rsquo;t immediately know where to look for the sorcerer and begin wandering Farfaria looking for him, the optional encounters <em>Centaurs and Spiders</em>, <em>Drops of Silver</em>, and <em>Elves of the Eastern Grove</em> all provide opportunities to be guided to the Castle of the North by non-player characters.</li><li>In the Castle of the North, adventurers can steal/borrow, buy, or trade for food and supplies. You may or may not want to have them get caught if they steal something and have to evade capture.</li><li>During the adventurers&rsquo; first encounter with the Sorcerer, in the Castle of the North, the sorcerer should always get away. He&rsquo;s not intended to get caught yet.</li><li>While story can carry on if adventurers skip the East Tower, the Sorcerer&rsquo;s escape creates a heightened sense of struggle and tension for the final battle.</li><li>For battles involving numerous creatures, you can hold back some of the enemies and have them arrive as reinforcements after the initial wave is defeated, or you can send them in all at once to dial up the intensity.</li><li>The tunnel system map contains some tunnels blocked by fallen rocks that lead to other parts of the tunnel system. They can be used in other adventures (where the rocks may or may not be cleared).</li><li>Many of the maps have lots of side rooms and areas of exploration. You may wish to cover up the parts behind doors until after adventurers open them, revealing the world much in the same way adventurers would experience it in real life.</li></ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>When you arrive at the harbor, Triton is at the surface, sitting on the back of a narwhal. The mermaid is with him. You walk to the edge of the dock and hand him the shell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he begins, &ldquo;for returning my daughter, and the Shell of Atlantis. You&rsquo;ve spared Farfaria a terrible fate at the hands of the sorcerer. I cannot thank you enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>If adventurers opted into the Old Man of the Sea&rsquo;s side-adventure:</strong> The old man has been sitting silently at the end of the dock. With barely a splash, he slides into the water.</p>

<p>You gasp and run over. He pops back up but a moment later, transformed. His skin is greenish-blue, his beard a beautiful lavender, his eyes, still glass-blue, but alert and piercing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you may have guessed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a merfolk wizard. Were you able to retrieve the magical hook?&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If the adventurers were successful:</strong> &ldquo;Thank you! We had believed this lost for good.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>If not:</strong> &ldquo;You certainly had more important things to focus on. Perhaps another quest for another day.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The Game Master should choose appropriately awesome rewards for completing these adventures.</em></p>
