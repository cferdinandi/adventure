	<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

	<p>This is a complicated, linear storyline with three separate acts containing multiple critical encounters. There&rsquo;s also a lot more room for world exploration and side-encounters than some of the other adventures.</p>
	
	<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Critical Encounters:</strong></p>
	<ol><li><strong>The East Tower.</strong> Players encounter the wizard for the first time. His daring escape creates heightened tension in the final act.</li><li><strong>The Dungeon.</strong> Players are sent on a quest to the mines.</li><li><strong>The Mines.</strong> After saving the mermaid, they learn of a new threat: the magical shell.</li><li><strong>The Hideout.</strong> The big finale concludes with a battle between the players and the sorcerer.</li></ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When you arrive at the harbor, Triton is at the surface, sitting on the back of a narwhal. The mermaid is with him. You walk to the edge of the dock and hand him the shell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he begins, &ldquo;for returning my daughter, and the Shell of Atlantis. You&rsquo;ve spared Farfaria a terrible fate at the hands of the sorcerer. I cannot thank you enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>If players opted into the Old Man of the Sea&rsquo;s side-adventure:</strong> The old man has been sitting silently at the end of the dock. With barely a splash, he slides into the water.</p>

<p>You gasp and run over. He pops back up but a moment later, transformed. His skin is greenish-blue, his beard a beautiful lavender, his eyes, still glass-blue, but alert and piercing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you may have guessed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a merfolk wizard. Were you able to retrieve the magical hook?&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If the players were successful:</strong> &ldquo;Thank you! We had believed this lost for good.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>If not:</strong> &ldquo;You certainly had more important things to focus on. Perhaps another quest for another day.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The Guide should choose appropriately awesome rewards for completing these adventures.</em></p>
