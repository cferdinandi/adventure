{{<callout title="Examples">}}
- Retrieve the Conch of Calling from the Isle of the Kraken before it falls into the wrong hands.
- Deliver this letter to Dr. Morrison before sundown tomorrow. But beware! There's a guild of thieves who are very interested in its contents.
- You awake to find yourself trapped at the bottom of a pit. It's dark, and your gear is nowhere to be found. You hear faint chanting off in the distance...
- Two weeks ago, the village well unexpected ran dry. Several villagers went into the sewers to see if they could figure out what's wrong, but they never returned. Without fresh water, crops are starting to wilt on the vine.
