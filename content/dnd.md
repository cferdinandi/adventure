Quill is an eccentric little forest gnome bard. After leaving his forest village to go on an adventure, he discovered that he also loves the coast and sea.

His messy hair and beard are decorated with shells, charms, gems, and colorful thread&mdash;each a souvenir from an adventure he's been on.

As a forest gnome, he has an innate love for small animals, furry and otherwise. Everywhere he travels, he’s likely to have a squirrel or bunny (or, while at sea, a crab or ship rat) by his side.

<summary><strong>Backstory</strong></summary>
{{%md%}}
Quill is uncharacteristically enthusiastic for a forest gnome.

Usually quiet and private, Quill loves to meet new creatures of all (err… most) races, trade stories, and sing songs. Tired of feeling like a misfit among his people, Quill left his idyllic village, and struck out in search of adventure and new companions.

After wandering from town to town for a decade or so, Quill found himself at a seaside hamlet, where he discovered a love of the ocean (and the wonderful little creatures that live there).

He took up work aboard a merchant ship (sometimes legit, sometimes a bit below the law) as a deckhand and onboard entertainment.

Having spent the last 18 years traveling throughout the known land (and seas), Quill’s in search of a new adventure.

<summary><strong>Personality</strong></summary>
{{%md%}}
Quill has a lust for life that’s more common of rock gnomes than forest. He’s a bit too enthusiastic at times (imagine a puppy that chugged a RedBull), and his biggest passion beyond meeting new people is chocolate.

Nearly two decades as a sailor’s has given Quill a flavorful language would make his kinfolk blush. He’s not much for grog, but he does love a good berry wine.

As a forest gnome, he has an innate love for small animals, furry and otherwise. Everywhere he travels, he’s likely to have a squirrel or bunny (or, while at sea, a crab or ship rat) by his side.

Despite his outgoing nature, forest gnomes aren’t a particularly common sight. They generally avoid outsiders. As a result, people don’t always know what to make of Quill, the hyperactive little gnome that can talk to animals.

His biggest fear in life is feeling like an outcast.

Also, running out chocolate. He’ll happily face down dragons and giants, but gods help him if he runs out of chocolate.

## Hair

Longish, but not Fabio/Legolas/ponytail long. More like Sam or Frodo from *Lord of the Rings*, but spikier.

	<div class="grid-third margin-bottom">
		<img alt="" src="/img/dnd/hair4.jpg">
	</div>
</div>

It's not fully braided or dreadlocked, but there are random stands that have shells, starfish, charms (ex. a small anchor), and colorful yarn woven in.

## Beard

Quill's beard is moderate in length&mdash;not short or trimmed, but not crazy long either.

</div>

Just as with his hair, his beard has a few charms, shells, and threads woven into it (but not so many that it's overwhelming, heavy, or distracting).
