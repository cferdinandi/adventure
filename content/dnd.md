Quill is an eccentric little forest gnome bard. After leaving his forest village to go on an adventure, he discovered that he also loves the coast and sea.

His messy hair and beard are decorated with shells, charms, gems, and colorful thread&mdash;each a souvenir from an adventure he's been on.

As a forest gnome, he has an innate love for small animals, furry and otherwise. Everywhere he travels, he’s likely to have a squirrel or bunny (or, while at sea, a crab or ship rat) by his side.

## Instruments

1. A flute made from a tree branch
2. A conch shell horn

## Hair

Longish, but not Fabio/Legolas/ponytail long. More like Sam or Frodo from *Lord of the Rings*, but spikier.

	<div class="grid-third margin-bottom">
		<img alt="" src="/img/dnd/hair4.jpg">
	</div>
</div>

It's not fully braided or dreadlocked, but there are random stands that have shells, starfish, charms (ex. a small anchor), and colorful yarn woven in.

## Beard

Quill's beard is moderate in length&mdash;not short or trimmed, but not crazy long either.

</div>

Just as with his hair, his beard has a few charms, shells, and threads woven into it (but not so many that it's overwhelming, heavy, or distracting).
