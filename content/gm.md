The Game Master has a big impact on how much fun Adventure is to play. Here are some tips and principles to make it as easy and successful as possible for you.

_You can find a [one-page GM cheatsheet on the downloads page](/downloads)._

<div data-toc="Table of Content"></div>



## The Three Principles

Adventure is all about creating a shared story with your players. The GM describes things in the world, and narrates what happens in response to the players' actions.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>The three principles that guide the GM are...</strong></p>

1. Portray a fantastic world.
2. Fill the characters' lives with adventure.
3. Play to find out what happens.

{{<callout>}}
**Focus on the story.** Whenever you’re unsure what should happen, ask yourself what makes sense in the context of the world you're exploring. If the rules get in the way or don’t quite fit, ignore them.

## Starting the Game

Start a game of Adventure by describing the fantastic location or tense situation the players find themselves in. Throw them right into the action.

Then, ask them questions about why they’re there, what they know, and how they know it. Use their answers to give the world depth and drive the game forward.

Finally, end with a call-to-action: “What do you do?”

{{<callout title="Example: The Isle of the Kraken">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>A Fantastic Location</strong></p>

Once every few years, a tiny island mysteriously rises from the depths of the sea for just a few hours. It never appears in the same place twice. Sometimes, it disappears before anyone’s even taken notice.

In the center of the island is a stone monolith, a small tower with a carving of a kraken at the top. It’s rumored that a powerful wizard who lived there thousands of years ago hid a legendary artifact somewhere on the island.

Many an explorer has ventured to the island searching for it. None have returned. Tonight, the island has surfaced again. You’re in a rowboat, headed in the direction it was allegedly seen. Water laps at the low sides of the boat. Suddenly, you catch sight of it.

In the distance, you see the monolith, the carving of the kraken lit brightly by the full moon above. How long has the island been at the surface? How much longer until it disappears again?

You row harder...

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

- How did you learn that the island had resurfaced?
- What artifact is hidden there? What is it rumored to do?
- Why are you interested in exploring the island or retrieving the artifact?
- What do you know of the wizard who used to live there?
- Who else might be interested in the island or artifact?

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Call-to-Action</strong></p>
As you approach the shore, you see a ship moored to a tree, a black flag with two crossed tridents flapping in the gentle breeze. You notice two pirates asleep next to the tree. Foot prints lead into the forest towards the monolith.

What do you do?

## Creating a Living World

As a GM, you want create a living world for the players to explore.

Identifying a few aspects of your world ahead of time can make it a lot easier to improvise, respond to what your players do, and breathe life into your world.

<div class="list-spaced">
{{%md%}}
- **Fantastic Locations.** Amazing places that the players can explorer, with a few details and unique features. Imagine a place that's really big, really old, or really weird.
- **Dangers.** What kind of creatures live there? What sort of natural obstacles might they encounter? What traps might have been set to keep trespassers away?
- **Secrets.** As players explore the world, they'll uncover secrets and hidden mysteries. Identify a few that you can reveal when it makes sense in the story.
- **Treasure & Magic Items.** Treasure and magic items can reveal secrets about the world, drive a quest, or give the players new powers and abilities.
- **Fronts.** The big players and forces in a campaign, these are things that will affect the world and unfold in sequence unless the players intervene. One to three are good for a short campaign, but you can have five or more for a bigger one.
{{%/md%}}
</div>

These are modular, and designed be dropped into the story whenever appropriate.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Locations</strong></p>

### Meaningful Magic Items

One of the most exciting parts of exploring fantastic locations is finding magical items.

The most meaningful items are tied to the locations where they're found, and provide some kind of minor benefit or magical effect. What's the story behind them? How do they thematically tie into your world?

If you need inspiration, you can download a long list of [minor magical abilities on GM Binder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MMz32Kxwu31dLnB5KXr). Modify them as needed.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
The Isle of the Kraken was home to merfolk wizard who spent his days experimenting on sea creatures and crafting items from their magical properties.

Armor of the Leatherback Turtle
: Provides advantage on defense rolls and heals one moderate injury at the end of any combat encounter.

Seaweed of Speed
: When consumed, the person who eats this seaweed is able to run twice as fast as they normally could.

Ring of Aquatic Beasts
: A ring made of abalone. The wearer rubs ring and names an aquatic animal. On a 9+, you gain two traits of named animal for 1 hour. On a 6-8, the GM chooses one of those two traits.
{{</callout>}}

### Non-Player Characters

Depending on the skills of the players and the difficulty of the challenges they’re facing, it can be interesting to add _Non-Player Characters (NPCs)_ into the game.

These are characters that the Game Master creates and controls. They can be friends, foes, or somewhere in-between.

NPCs can provide critical information that players aren’t picking up on, give them misinformation to send them on a bonus encounter, jump in to provide extra fire power for an epic battle, or thwart their efforts if they’re finding an adventure too easy.

They could be shopkeepers who can sell useful items to the players in exchange for favors or gold. Or they might be inn keepers who provide a place to rest before a big campaign.

Use NPCs as much or as little as needed to keep the game fun and interesting.



## Story & Mechanics

One of the more challenging aspects of running a game of Adventure is translating story elements into mechanics (and back again). 

This section has some tips and ideas on how to do that.

### Translating Skills into Mechanics

You can make the skills your characters have feel more rich and meaningful by adding mechanics like advantage and disadvantage around them.

- When a character does something related to [skill or ability], roll with advantage.
- A character has the ability to [power they can actively choose to use]. Roll to see what happens.
- A character has [special power with a constant effect].
- A character has [object]. When applicable, roll with advantage.

Giving them benefits and costs based on their choices makes their characters and the world feel more real.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Fin is an elf with the ability to speak to animals, a talent for nature magic, and a staff made from a magic birch tree.

Elven Agility
: At home in the trees, you're quick and agile. Roll with advantage when doing something that requires agility.

Elemental Magic
: You can control the elements of earth, wind, fire, and water. Roll to see what happens. On a 9+, the desired effect comes to pass. On a 6-8, you also lose control of the effect.

Animal Friendship
: After spending years in the forest, you've learned to communicate with animals.

Staff of the Woodlands
: You possess a staff made from an enchanted birch tree. Whenever you cast nature spells, roll with advantage.
{{</callout>}}

### Common Dice Rolls & Outcomes

There are a handful of types of die rolls that happen frequently in adventure. Here are some ideas for improvising outcomes to them.

Cast Spells
: When casting a difficult or powerful spell...
	- **9+** The spell works
	- **6-8** The spell works, but you draw unwelcome attention or lose control of it

Combat
: When fighting, either close-up or from afar with ranged weapons...
	- **9+** Deal your damage
	- **6-8** Deal your damage, and enemy hits you or you get put in a tough spot

Defy Danger
: Any time you try to avoid danger or getting hurt...
	- **9+** You succeed
	- **6-8**  You stumble, and choose from a worse outcome or tough choice

Defend
: When you try to defend yourself of a teammate from an attack...
	- **9+** Block the attack
	- **6-8** Reduce the damage, or block all of it but damage or lose something

Understand the World
: Whenever you try to study the world around you, a person, or a situation... On a 9+, ask three questions. On a 6-8, ask one.
	- What happened here recently?
	- What is about to happen?
	- What should I be on the lookout for?
	- What here is useful or valuable to me?
	- Who’s really in control here?
	- What here is not what it appears to be?

Recall Knowledge
: Whenever your character tries to recall something that they would know in the story...
	- **9+** The GM will tell you something interesting and useful
	- **6-8** The GM will tell you something interesting only

Influence
: When you try to persuade or intimidate someone...
	- **9+** They do what you want
	- **6-8** They do what you want, but require something from you first

Last Breath
: When a character is dying...
	- **9+** Death allows them to return to the living
	- **6-8** Death requires something in return

### Make Failure Interesting

Statistically, failed die rolls will happen about a quarter of the time a player rolls. Even when a player fails a roll, something should still _happen_.

Otherwise, it's boring and disappointing.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
- **The player fails to pick the lock on the chest.** It springs a trap, causing the room to lock and start filling with water!
- **The player tries to jump across a cliff and fails the roll.** They slam into the cliff wall and fall onto a ledge 20 feet down. They think they've escaped the worst of it... until the ledge starts to shift and crack under their weight.
{{</callout>}}

### Accounting for Difficulty

Under the die roll system, every action has the same probability of succeeding (or not).

But some actions are inherently more difficult than others. In addition to advantage and disadvantage mechanics, you can account for difficulty in complex situations by breaking each step into its own die roll.

{{<callout title="Example">}}
A player is trying to run up to a giant, scale his 20-foot high boot, and hit him with a sword. This would involve three separate die rolls.

1. A roll to sneak up to the giant undetected (or avoid obstacles thrown at you while approaching).
2. Another roll to scale the boot without falling or getting knocked off.
3. A third roll to see if the hit with the sword does anything.

You might also require a roll to identify which part of the boot to climb, or a blind spot where the adventurer can sneak up undetected.
{{</callout>}}

### Applying Advantage & Disadvantage

Skills and items that provide an advantage in one situation may provide a disadvantage in another.

- Armor can provide an advantage when blocking an attack, but a disadvantage when trying to move quickly or quietly.
- Being large can provide an advantage when trying to move something heavy, but a disadvantage when trying to hide.
- A dark room can provide an advantage when trying to hide, but a disadvantage when trying to attack an enemy.

Identifying the benefits and challenges of various skills, items, and situations can help you apply advantage and disadvantage to create a more realistic world.

### Magic & Spellcasting

While simple spells can be cast at will, complex and powerful spells require a roll of the dice, and may have unintended side-effects or draw unwanted attention if they fail.

The spells you cast should work thematically with the player's character. Have the player describe what they want to do, and tell them if its possible and how it might work. 

Players can acquire new spells, abilities, weapons, and magic items on their travels.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Fin specializes in nature magic.

- **He wants to light a small fire by snapping his fingers.** This is a simple spell that can be cast at will and always works.
- **He wants to make vines grow out of the earth and tangle an enemy.** This is a complex spell. He rolls 2D6.
	+ **9+:** It works as expected.
	+ **6-8:** It works, but also tangles one of the other players.
	+ **5-:** Fin's connection to the earth breaks, and the spell fails.
- **He tries to teleport.** This isn't nature magic, so nothing happens.
- **He acquires a ring of teleportation, and wants to use it.** He rolls 2D6 to see what happens.
{{</callout>}}

### Crafting, Tinkering & Repairs

Players might want to craft items, build mechanical inventions, or repair damaged equipment.

Simple items may only need a bit of time and a safe place to work. More complex items may require special ingredients or materials, and might also require a dice roll to see if it works or not.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Spark the dragon crafts magical potions brewed into tea.

- **They want to craft a simple healing potion.** This is their signature tea, and works as long as Spark can find an hour of time to combine the ingredients and brew the tea.
- **They've been in a cave system for a few days, and want to brew a healing potion.** Spark is low on the required ingredients, and will need to acquire some first. They roll 2D6 to see if they can scavenge some of the required mushrooms for a nearby tunnel.
- **They're trying to craft a new potion that lets the drinker breath underwater.** Spark rolls 2D6 to scavenge the required ingredients, and another 2D6 to see if their potion works as expected.
{{</callout>}}

### Creature Mechanics

Creatures in your world are likely to be quite varied.

Small creatures like rats and goblins might take their final breath after a single moderate injury. A group of them may go down in a single attack. Large creatures like dragons, with tough scales and fire breath, may be virtually invincible.

They may attack in hordes or avoid conflict entirely. They might be friendly or aloof or aggressive. They have special abilities, or nothing but claws and fangs. Be as weird and creative as you want.

### Fight or Flee

It's very unlikely that a creature will fight to the death. 

Most are likely to avoid conflict unless confident they can win, and flee when things look dire. Account for this in your combat.

If the players turn the tide of battle or take out the group's leader, you can choose to have the enemies surrender or flee instead of continuing to fight. If you're unsure, you can always roll to find out what happens.

### Total Group Knock Out

If every member of a group takes their last breath, that’s a called a _Total Group Knock Out (or TGKO)_.

A TGKO can happen if the group misjudges how dangerous a situation is. It can also happen if luck just doesn’t work in the players’ favor (like a series of low dice rolls).

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Since a TGKO would otherwise stop the adventure in its tracks, the Game Master can use their creativity to save players from this situation.</strong></p>

- A pet belonging to one of the players runs off and returns with healing potion, or a non-player character that can help.
- Players awaken some unknown time later. The creature is gone, along with what they were looking for and a bunch of their gear and items.
- Players awaken to find themselves trapped in a locked room, unsure of where they are or how they got there. They must use their skills and items they can find in there surroundings to escape.

This can add a really fun new aspect to the game, so don’t be afraid to get creative!



## Duration and Complexity

Games of Adventure can take as little as 30 minutes or last several hours.

As the Game Master, you have a lot of control over the length and complexity of each game. You can add or remove creatures, reveal or discard secrets, adjust the HP of creatures, and save the day with NPCs.

You can also spread an adventure over several sessions, stopping after an encounter, and picking things back up another time.
