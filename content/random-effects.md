Whether you're using [the Chaos Magic house rule](/rules#chaos-magic) or just need a random effect for a potion or herb, this table can help you quickly come up with some ideas.

Roll two D6 dice, or one D20 and flip a coin. Then find the matching numbers on the table (_H is heads, T is tails_). All effects end after a minute.
