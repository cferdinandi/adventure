My [premade adventures](/adventures) are set in the fictional land of Farfaria.

Here's an intro you can use if you need help getting started.

> You live in the land of Farfaria, in a tiny little village nestled between a mountain range and a sweeping forest.
>
> Rivers flow down from the mountains, cut through your village, and run through the forest, where they eventually connect with the ocean.
>
> While Farfaria is a small and remote town, you're hardly alone. The woods and mountains are filled with amazing, magical creatures: elves, fairies, centaurs, and wizards. They're filled with dangerous creatures—thieves, giants, and ogres—too. The ocean to the south is home to mermaids, krakens, and other monsters of the deep.
>
> Mysterious and exciting adventures always seem to find their way to your little village, where you and your friends are ready to help...
