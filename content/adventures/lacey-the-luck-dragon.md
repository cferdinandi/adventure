details: The babies just learned to fly, and aren’t very good at it. For protection, baby luck dragons can turn themselves invisible, making them hard to find. Baby dragons screech, scratch stuff with their claws, accidentally burn things, and smell like wet dog. The dragon gives you a satchel of gold coins to help you on your journey.

The sound of dragon screeches get louder, finally reaching a peak. You look around, but don't see anything. Then you look up.

High up in a tree, tangled in vines, is a baby dragon. She tried flying, but still isn't very good at it, and got herself stuck.

{{%encounter order="3" title="Spider's Den" prompt="How do you cut the baby dragon loose without getting yourself stuck, *and* avoid being caught by the giant spider?" tips="While you certainly can fight the spider, players might also try distracting her while one of them grabs the baby dragon." difficulty="Up to three players: 5||Four or more players: 6" battle="Giant Spider" villains="Spider: Difficulty - 5, Health - 2" success="*[If the players battled the spider]:* Having successfully defeated the spider, you carefully cut the baby dragon free of the web and carry him out of the cave.<br><br>*[If the players distracted the spider]:* While the spider is distracted, you cut the baby dragon free of the web, grab him, and quickly run out of the cave.

You hear the screeching of a baby dragon coming from deep within a cave. You slowly wander in, unsure what you'll find.

You turn the bend and let out a gasp. The baby dragon is caught in a giant spider's web, and standing next to the web is a giant spider the size of a full grown human!

{{%encounter order="4" title="The Mountain Cliff" prompt="How will you reach the baby dragon, and how will you safely lower her to the ground?" tips="Players can use their skills, or tools they've acquired. They can also use things they find in their surroundings, such as trees or vines." difficulty="One or two players: 3||Three or four players: 4||Five or more players: 5" success="With the baby dragon safely back on the ground, you look around and try to figure out where to go next." location="Where the Woods of the West meets the Northern Mountains" scenary="Forest, Mountain, Cliff" item="Decide in the moment" next="Any encounter, 2-6"%}}
Following the site of smoke, you arrive the edge of a tall cliff. Looking up, you see the baby dragon, dangling her neck over the edge, looking for help. A small shrub is on fire behind her.

The cliff is too high to jump up, and too smooth and steep to climb. You'll have to figure out another way to reach the baby dragon.

As you think about how you're going to get up to her, you notice that one of her wings appears broken. Getting her back to the ground will be challenging.

{{%encounter order="5" title="The Cave of the Sleeping Ogre" prompt="How will you get the baby dragon out without waking up the ogre?" tips="There are a variety of ways players can solve this challenge.

Then, as quickly as you can, you sneak back out, careful not to knock over any loose rocks on your way out.<br><br>*[If the players reach a diplomatic solution]:* The ogre agrees to your terms, and happily exchanges the baby dragon with you.

You head to the opening of the cave where you thought you heard screeching. It's silent now, but you can detect the distinct and overpowering smell of wet dog.

You walk into the cave, but come to an immediate halt. You see the baby dragon curled up in a back corner of the cave... tucked behind a sleeping ogre!

{{%encounter order="6" title="The Supply Shop" prompt="You suspect a dragon is hidden in the back room. What do you do?" tips="Playes can try bartering with the shop owner, try to fight him, or break in.

As you make your way through the hills and farmland, you happen across a supply shop and decide to stop in. You need food, drink, and rest.

You hide the baby dragons you've found so far behind a grove of trees, and head into the store.

While looking at items on the shelves, you notice the faint but distinct smell of wet dog. Looking around, you see little wisps of smoke drifting out from under the door to the supply room in the back.

You ask the shop owner about it, and he denies knowing anything. "It appears I've burned my lunch," he insists, and hurries you out of his shop.

In the depths of the deep pool, you see something glinting when the light hits it just right. The pool seems quite deep, about 25 feet. What could be at the bottom?

The dog growls and bares its teeth, clearly displeased that there are intruders in his tunnel.

You hear leaves rustling to your left. Moments later, a band of thieves emerges from the woods, daggers drawn, arrows at the ready. Some are on foot, others on horseback. You’re on edge.

They offer to buy a baby dragon from you for a healthy sum, and offer you gold, gear, and other useful items.

You hear a battle cry and an arrow whizzes by overhead. A horse whinnies and the sound of horse hoofs on soft dirt echoing from the trees.

The band of thieves emerges from the trees, bent on stealing the baby dragon.

## Conclusion

{{%conclusion location="The Village" item="Magic Gloves"%}}
You return to the village with all five of Lacey the Luck Dragon's babies.

She emerges from the shadows, lowers her head to the ground, and looks each of you in the eye. “Thank you, truly, for returning my babies. I cannot thank you enough for what you have done.”
