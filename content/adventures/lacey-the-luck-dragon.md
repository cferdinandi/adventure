The dragon who protects your village has lost her babies. She needs your help to get them back.

<div data-toc="In This Adventure"></div>



## The Situation

Lacey the Luck Dragon protects the forest and village from invaders. While out looking for food, her five baby dragons wandered off, and she can’t find them. She’s worried sick, and wants your help in locating them.

The babies just learned to fly, and aren’t very good at it. For protection, baby luck dragons can turn themselves invisible, making them hard to find. Baby dragons screech, scratch stuff with their claws, accidentally burn things, and smell like wet dog.

Until the babies are returned, she'll be far too distressed to protect the village.

## In Media Res

You tried to be quiet, but you didn't notice the loose golden chalice on the ground. It made _just_ enough noise when you kicked it to wake up the sleeping ogre.

As he rubs the sleep from his eyes, he notices you and jumps up for the pile of smelly animal pelts he calls a bed. At least twice your height, his smelly, hot breath is overpowering as he yells,

> What are you doing in me cave?

Behind him, locked in a cage, is one of the baby dragons the Luck Dragon asked you to find and return.

- One of you was reaching for a few of the ogre's coins when it woke up. Who?
- One of you is behind the ogre, and they haven't noticed you yet. Which one of you?
- Before you left, a rare animals dealer approached one of you and secretly offered you something in exchange for one of the baby dragons? Who, and what did they offer you?
- The baby dragon is cute, but dangerous. What happens if you try to pick it up without wearing gloves?

## Game Master Tips

- If the baby dragons aren’t returned in time, goblins ambush the unprotected village. The players will need to decide how to focus their time at that point: on rescuing the baby dragons, or protecting the village.
- If you want a longer campaign, have the bandits make off with a dragon. It will create an additional side campaign the players will need to complete.
