## The Situation

Lacey the Luck Dragon protects the forest and village from invaders. While out looking for food, her five baby dragons wandered off, and she can’t find them. She’s worried sick, and wants your help in locating them.

The babies just learned to fly, and aren’t very good at it. For protection, baby luck dragons can turn themselves invisible, making them hard to find. Baby dragons screech, scratch stuff with their claws, accidentally burn things, and smell like wet dog.

Until the babies are returned, she'll be far too distressed to protect the village.


## Locations

- **The Forest.** Tall trees and tangles of vines provide ample places for baby dragons to get stuck.
- **Spider Den.** Among a grove a trees, a giant spider guards a massive web that could easy capture a baby dragon.
- **Mountain Cliffs.** High up on the edge of the cliffs, a dragon just learning to fly could easily find themselves unable to get down.
- **The Supply Shop.** A remote supply shop provides food and goods to weary travelers. But you can't help but notice something strange (smells, sounds, or smoke) coming from the the back room.
- **Cave of the Sleeping Ogre.** A cave system is home to a giant ogre and his cavern home. He happens to be asleep at the moment, but a giant pile of gold (and a baby dragon) lie behind him.
- **The Tunnels.** Beyond the Sleeping Ogre's home is a network of tunnels. Adventurers can escape into them if needed.
	+ **The Deep Pool.** It’s not very clear, but in the glow of the bioluminescent fungi on the walls, you see something glinting at the bottom. The pool seems quite deep, about 25 feet. What could be at the bottom?
