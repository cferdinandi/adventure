The dragon who protects your village has lost her babies. She needs your help to get them back.

<div data-toc="In This Adventure"></div>



## The Situation

Lacey the Luck Dragon protects the forest and village from invaders. While out looking for food, her five baby dragons wandered off, and she can’t find them. She’s worried sick, and wants your help in locating them.

The babies just learned to fly, and aren’t very good at it. For protection, baby luck dragons can turn themselves invisible, making them hard to find. Baby dragons screech, scratch stuff with their claws, accidentally burn things, and smell like wet dog.

Until the babies are returned, she'll be far too distressed to protect the village.

## Game Master Tips

- If the baby dragons aren’t returned in time, goblins ambush the unprotected village. The players will need to decide how to focus their time at that point: on rescuing the baby dragons, or protecting the village.
- If you want a longer campaign, have the bandits make off with a dragon. It will create an additional side campaign the players will need to complete.
