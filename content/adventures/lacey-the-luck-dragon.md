The dragon who protects your village has lost her babies. She needs your help to get them back.

<div data-toc="In This Adventure"></div>



## Introduction

Lacey the Luck Dragon protects the forest and village from invaders. While out looking for food, her five baby dragons wandered off, and she can’t find them. The babies just learned to fly, and aren’t very good at it. She’s worried sick.

For the last few hours, you've been deep in the forest searching for them.

The one you've found so far is currently gnawing on a piece of scrap leather. You're on the lookout for signs of the other four. But you also keep hearing the snapping of branches in the distance, and could swear you've seen a hooded figure disappear behind the trees on more than one occasion.

Look! Listen! Smoke and the cries of a baby dragon in the distance!

## Monsters & Traps

## Game Master Tips

- If the baby dragons aren’t returned in time, goblins ambush the unprotected village. The players will need to decide how to focus their time at that point: on rescuing the baby dragons, or protecting the village.
- If you want a longer campaign, have the bandits make off with a dragon. It will create an additional side campaign the players will need to complete.
