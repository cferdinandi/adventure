## The Situation

You’re enjoying lunch in the tavern with your friends when an elf bursts through the doors, out of breath with flush red cheeks. “There’s been an attack on Oakenshire,” he exclaims, “we’ve been completely overrun with spiders, and they’ve taken Lord Faelyn hostage!”

Oakenshire is the elves’ treetop home. It contains ancient books and special magic found nowhere else in Farfaria. Its safety is vital to Farfaria. The elves has always had a warm relationship with the people of the Village, and they need your help.


## Locations

Oakenshire is a small city built into the trees of the forest. It's a collection of treehouses connected to each other by bridges.

A rope ladder, out-of-reach and accessible only if someone from inside the city lowers it, provides access to the city. There's a second hidden entrance built into the roots of one of the trees that provides an emergency entrance and exit.

- **The Kitchen.** This room has a raised loft in the back with a small kitchen. You see a sink and wood stove against the back wall, a table and some chairs to the right. To your left are a set of stairs leading up to it.
- **The Library.** As soon as you walk into a room, the smell of old books hits your nostrils. Lining each wall are long, tall bookcases filled floor to ceiling with books. In the middle of the room is a simple room-length wooden table, with a long benches on each side. You’ve entered the elven library. These tomes contains ancient wisdom about the forests, passed down from one generation to next over the millennia. The knowledge contained here is irreplaceable.
- **The Lab.** Against the back wall is a standing-height table covered in books, beakers, and magical artifacts. This room is the elven lab, where they experiment with potions and unlock the mysteries of the universe.
- **Sleeping Quarters.** Rows of bunk beds line the walls, and create rows in the middle of the room. At the foot of each bed is an ornate chest that hold each elf’s clothes and other belongings. Magical candles glow in sconces mounted to the walls.
- **The Throne Room.** To the right is a sturdy desk, covered in crystals, potions, and a hardcover book. To the left is another tall bookcase filled with sacred texts. At your feed is an ornate purple and green carpet that leads to a large wooden throne at the back of the room. Animals and legendary elven figures are carved into the wood.
