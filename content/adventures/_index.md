To help you get started, I've put together some pre-made adventures you can go on.

Each one includes a summary, detailed encounters, detours and side-adventures the group can go on, and more. Feel free to modify and adapt these based on the toys you have available at home, and the interests of the people playing.

This is an imagination-based kitchen table game, so take it in whatever weird direction sounds fun to you!
