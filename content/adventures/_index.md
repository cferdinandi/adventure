## Third-Party

You can use the Adventure rule system with other RPGs. Here are some that have interesting stories and helpful Game Master guides.

- **[The Hero Kids Bundle.](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/115827/Hero-Kids--Complete-Fantasy-PDF-Bundle-BUNDLE)** Hero Kids is a complete RPG system that's a bit more rule-focused than Adventure. The premade adventures are great, and provide a lot of useful info for Game Masters.
- **[Adventures in Bayhaven.](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/165400/Adventures-in-Bayhaven-Ultimate-BUNDLE)** An expansion for Hero Kids that can also be played any other rule system. Players travel to a different village and embark on a series of adventures there.
- **[101 Koboldz.](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/281131/Hero-Kids--Fantasy-Premium-Adventure--101-Koboldz)** A hilarious, beautifully illustrated adventure in which players have to rescue a hoard of kind but mischievous creatures and return them to their home in the mountains.
- **[In Yuletide: An Univited Guest.](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/298178/Hero-Kids--Fantasy-Premium-Adventure--Yuletide--An-Uninvited-Guest)** A holidays adventure that draws from the pagan tradition that pre-date Christmas, from the team behind 101 Koboldz.
- **[The Big Trouble Bundle.](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/301410/Big-Trouble-Mammoth-Collection-BUNDLE)** When a mysterious purple rock falls from the sky and shrinks the players down to the size of insects, they must embark on a journey to restore themselves to full size and save humanity.
