To help you get started, I've put together some pre-made adventures you can go on.

Each one includes background information for the *Guide*, detailed encounters, and more. Feel free to modify and adapt these based on the toys you have available at home, and the interests of the people playing. Take it in whatever weird direction sounds fun to you!

**Write your own adventure?** I'd love to add it to this site! Send me an email at {{<email>}}.
