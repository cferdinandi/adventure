premise: Lacey the Luck Dragon protects the forest from invaders. While out looking for food, her five baby dragons wandered off, and she can’t find them. She’s worried sick, and wants your help in locating them.
details: The babies just learned to fly, and aren’t very good at it. For protection, baby luck dragons can turn themselves invisible, making them hard to find. Baby dragons screech, scratch stuff with their claws, accidentally burn things, and smell like wet&nbsp;dog.<br><br>Lacey gives you a satchel of gold coins to help you on your journey.
intro: This story has five critical, nonlinear encounters that can be completed in any order. All involve the players rescuing baby dragons from creatures or situations.
storyline:
- A dragon explains that she's lost her babies and needs help finding them. The adventurers search Farfaria for them.
- They rescue a dragon tangled in forest vines, a dragon caught in a giant spider's web, a dragon stuck on a high cliff, a dragon inside a sleeping ogre's cave, and a dragon held captive in a supply shop.
- As an optional encounter, the adventurers can explore the caves and tunnels of Farfaria (on purpose, or while fleeing from an ogre or giant spider).
- As an optional encounter, thieves can offer to buy a baby dragon from the adventurers. If they refuse, the thieves later attempt a raid to steal one.
villains: ['Spider', 'Ogre', 'Shopkeeper', 'Thieves']
npcs: ['Dragons']
tips:
- After each encounter, the players' next task will be figuring out where to find the next baby dragon. You may need to provide help here in the form of suggestions or a non-player character.
- After saving a baby dragon from the *Forest Vines*, *The Mountain Cliff*, or *The Supply Shop*, you can move players into one of the optional *Thieves Make an Offer* encounters if you want. If that happens, you can later introduce *The Thieves Raid*.
- If players decide to flee into or explore the tunnel system in the *Spider's Den* or *Cave of the Sleeping Ogre*, challenges, jump to *The Tunnels* encounters.
startingEncounter: Locate the first baby dragon

### 1. The Village

{{%encounter order="a" title="Locate the first baby dragon" tips="Players can look for smoke or fires, listen for dragon screeches, or smell wet dog odors. They might also pay off a local who's seen something, or use tracking skills." difficulty="Up to three players: 4||Four players of more: 5" success="With skill and a little bit of luck, you think you've located the first baby dragon. You set off to bring them home."%}}
Lacey has provided some basic information about her babies and how they behave. You also have various skills and items at your disposal.

*How will you locate the first baby dragon?*
{{%/encounter%}}

### 2. Fairy Forest

{{%encounter order="a" title="Forest Vines" difficulty="Up to three players: 4||Four or more players: 6" success="Safely back on the ground, the baby dragon licks your face with her scratchy sandpaper tongue, covering you in a slick, green mucus. She's glad to be back on the ground." bonus="Thieves Make an Offer"%}}
The sound of dragon screeches get louder, finally reaching a peak. You look around, but don't see anything. Then you look up. High up in a tree, tangled in vines, is a baby dragon. She tried flying, but still isn't very good at it, and got herself stuck.

*How do you get her down safely?*
{{%/encounter%}}

### 3. Woods of the West

{{%encounter order="a" title="Spider's Den" tips="While you certainly can fight the spider, players might also try distracting her while one of them grabs the baby dragon." difficulty="Up to three players: 5||Four or more players: 6" battle="Giant Spider" villains="Spider: Difficulty - 5, Health - 2" success="*[If the players battled the spider]:* Having successfully defeated the spider, you carefully cut the baby dragon free of the web and carry him out of the cave.<br><br>*[If the players distracted the spider]:* While the spider is distracted, you cut the baby dragon free of the web, grab him, and quickly run out of the cave. Your teammates are close behind." bonus="Into the Tunnels"%}}
You hear the screeching of a baby dragon coming from deep within a cave. You slowly wander in, unsure what you'll find.

You turn the bend and let out a gasp. The baby dragon is caught in a giant spider's web, and standing next to the web is a giant spider the size of a full grown human!

*How do you cut the baby dragon loose without getting yourself stuck, and avoid being caught by the giant spider?*
{{%/encounter%}}

### 4. The Northern Mountains

{{%encounter order="a" title="The Mountain Cliff" tips="Players can use their skills, or tools they've acquired. They can also use things they find in their surroundings, such as trees or vines." difficulty="One or two players: 3||Three or four players: 4||Five or more players: 5" success="With the baby dragon safely back on the ground, you look around and try to figure out where to go next."%}}
Following the site of smoke, you arrive the edge of a tall cliff. Looking up, you see the baby dragon, dangling her neck over the edge, looking for help. A small shrub is on fire behind her.

The cliff is too high to jump up, and too smooth and steep to climb. You'll have to figure out another way to reach the baby dragon.

As you think about how you're going to get up to her, you notice that one of her wings appears broken. Getting her back to the ground will be challenging.

*How will you reach the baby dragon, and how will you safely lower her to the ground?*

### 5. The Eastern Grove

{{%encounter order="a" title="The Cave of the Sleeping Ogre" tips="There are a variety of ways players can solve this challenge. They could try to sneak past the ogre, reason or trade with him, or battle him." difficulty="Up to three players: 5||Four or more players: 6" battle="A Giant Ogre" villains="Ogre: Difficulty 5, Health - 2" success="*[If the players battled the ogre]:* Having successfully defeated the ogre, you quickly run to the back of the cave, grab the baby dragon, and run back out of the cave. You're not taking any chances that he'll come back!<br><br>*[If the players snuck around ogre]:* You sneak past the sleeping ogre, and quietly scoop the baby dragon up in your arms. Then, as quickly as you can, you sneak back out, careful not to knock over any loose rocks on your way out.<br><br>*[If the players reach a diplomatic solution]:* The ogre agrees to your terms, and happily exchanges the baby dragon with you. You quickly run off before he has a chance to change his mind."%}}
You head to the opening of the cave where you thought you heard screeching. It's silent now, but you can detect the distinct and overpowering smell of wet dog.

You walk into the cave, but come to an immediate halt. You see the baby dragon curled up in a back corner of the cave... tucked behind a sleeping ogre!

*How will you get the baby dragon out without waking up the ogre?*

### 6. Hills & Farmland

{{%encounter order="a" title="The Supply Shop" tips="Playes can try bartering with the shop owner, try to fight him, or break in. They might also try distracting him while one player sneaks around to the entrance in the back.<br><br>As an added challenge, they may find the dragon locked in a cage and need to search for the key." difficulty="Up to three players: 4||Four or more players: 5" battle="The Shop Owner" villains="Shop Owner: Difficulty - 3, Health - 1" success="With the dragon successfully rescued from the back of the shop, you make a hasty exist before more trouble arrives."%}}
As you make your way through the hills and farmland, you happen across a supply shop and decide to stop in. You need food, drink, and rest.

You hide the baby dragons you've found so far behind a grove of trees, and head into the store.

While looking at items on the shelves, you notice the faint but distinct smell of wet dog. Looking around, you see little wisps of smoke drifting out from under the door to the supply room in the back.

You ask the shop owner about it, and he denies knowing anything. "It appears I've burned my lunch," he insists, and hurries you out of his shop.

*You suspect a dragon is hidden in the back room. What do you do?*

### 7. The Tunnels

<p class="margin-bottom-small">These optional encounters can take place in the tunnels off of the ogre den <em>or</em> the giant spider burrow.</p>

{{%encounter order="a" title="Into the Tunnels" optional="true" difficulty="3" success="You encounter a deep pool of water. It's not very clear, but in the glow of the bioluminescent fungi on the walls, you see something glinting at the bottom." failure="Out of the darkness, a giant three-headed dog emerges."%}}
Fleeing from the monster, you head deeper into the caves, and find yourself in a labyrinth of interconnected tunnels. You approach a fork in the path.

*Do you bear to the left, or turn right?*
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="The Deep Pool" optional="true" tips="Depending on how much action the group has seen, you can add an additional challenge to see if they successfully swim across. If they fail, they might get attacked by a water elemental." difficulty="One or two players: 4||Three or four players: 5||Five or more players: 6" success="After several attempts, you grasp the item in your outstretched hand and swim aggressively back to the surface. You emerge, take a deep breath, and look down at your hands. You're holding [*whatever item you decide they should find*]." failure="After several failed attempts, you decide to keep moving. Lacey is depending on you."%}}
In the depths of the deep pool, you see something glinting when the light hits it just right. The pool seems quite deep, about 25 feet. What could be at the bottom?

*Do you try to recover the item, or keep swimming across?*
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="c" title="The Three-Headed Dog" optional="true" tips="Players may choose to fight, use a tool or something in the surroundings to distract or trick the dog, or flee" difficulty="Up to three players: 5||Four or more players: 6" battle="Three-Headed Dog" villains="Three-Headed Dog: Difficulty - 5, Health - 3" success="With the three-headed monster defeated, you continue on your journey. As you walk past, you notice some items glinting in a dark corner, and find gear that will be useful as you continue on your adventure. You pick it up, and continue down the tunnel." failure="You quickly dart down a small side tunnel, too narrow for the three-headed beast to fit his broad shoulders. As you keep walking, you see daylight in the distance."%}}
As you round the bend, you come face-to-face with a giant three-headed dog. The dog growls and bares its teeth, clearly displeased that there are intruders in his tunnel.

### 8. The Forest

<p class="margin-bottom-small">These optional encounters can take place in the Fairy Forest, the Woods of the West, or the Eastern Grove.</p>

{{%encounter order="a" title="Thieves Make an Offer" optional="true" difficulty="3" battle="One or two players: 3 Thieves, 1 Leader||Three or four players: 5 Thieves, 1 Leader||Five or more players: 7 Thieves, 1 Leader" villains="Thieves: Difficulty - 3, Health - 1||Leader: Difficulty - 5, Health - 2" success="*[If they battled the thieves]* With the band of thieves successfully defeated, you continue on your journey.<br><br>*[If they declined the offer]* The thieves accept your decision, and disappear back into back into the shadows of the forest. Consider *Bonus 2b* as a follow-up encounter." failure="The thieves snatch a baby dragon and run off into the shadows of the forest. *[If the group agreed to sell the dragon]* You've been double crossed. They took off without paying you. *You'll need to improvise a campaign to retrieve the baby dragon if the group wants to get the dragon back or wants to collect their owed compensation.*"%}}
You hear leaves rustling to your left. Moments later, a band of thieves emerges from the woods, daggers drawn, arrows at the ready. Some are on foot, others on horseback. You’re on edge.

They offer to buy a baby dragon from you for a healthy sum, and offer you gold, gear, and other useful items.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="The Thieves Raid" optional="true" tips="To keep the battle more balanced, the thieves don't all need to attack at once. A few can hang back, and emerge from the shadows only after their peers are defeated." difficulty="Up to three players: 4||Four or more players: 5" battle="One or two players: 3 Thieves, 1 Leader||Three or four players: 5 Thieves, 1 Leader||Five or more players: 7 Thieves, 1 Leader" villains="Thieves: Difficulty - 3, Health - 1||Leader: Difficulty - 5, Health - 2" success="After running until your legs feel numb, you finally stop. You've lost the thieves. Time to continue on your mission." failure="The thieves snatch a baby dragon and run off into the shadows of the forest. *You'll need to improvise a campaign to retrieve the baby dragon if the group wants to get the dragon back or wants to collect their owed compensation.*"%}}
You hear a battle cry and an arrow whizzes by overhead. A horse whinnies and the sound of horse hoofs on soft dirt echoing from the trees.

The band of thieves emerges from the trees, bent on stealing the baby dragon.
{{%/encounter%}}

### Conclusion

You return to the village with all five of Lacey the Luck Dragon's babies.

She emerges from the shadows, lowers her head to the ground, and looks each of you in the eye. “Thank you, truly, for returning my babies. I cannot thank you enough for what you have done.”
