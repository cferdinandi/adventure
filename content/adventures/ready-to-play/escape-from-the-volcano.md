premise: You're enjoying lunch at the tavern when the door slams open, and an old man with disheveled hair and a long, white beard rushes into the room. "My son!" he exclaims. "He's been taken by the Fire Wizard!"
details: The man is from the village on the other side of the Norther Mountains. The Fire Wizard was last seen disappearing with the boy into the tunnels underneath the giant volcano at the edge of their village.<br><br>The boy possesses a magical gift. If his hand is placed upon the Heart Stone located deep inside the volcano, it will cause it to erupt, burying the village in an ocean of lava.
intro: "This adventure follows a linear storyline."
storyline:
- The adventurers must break through the cave opening, which has been sealed with now-hardened lava.
- Next, they must navigate across a lava pond and reach the other side.
- The adventurers must cross an old rope bridge that traverses a river of magma. It's old, and rickety, and looks like it might fall at any moment.
- To keep moving forward, the adventurers need to either battle a rock elemental, or a hoard of cave gnomes.
- The adventurers fall through a trap door into a deep pit that begins filling with lava. They need to escape before it floods completely.
- They come to a long, straight hallway, dotted with ornate figurines along the walls. As they walk, the figurines intermittently shoot fire from their mouths across the hall.
- The tunnel opens up into a large lava lake, with two islands of rock connected by bridges. As they make their way across, they're attacked by unseen archers.
- The adventurers finally come to the entrance to the subterranean palace of the Fire Wizard. They must reach the top of a tiered plaza, fighting goblins, archers, a lava elemental, and a rock elemental.
- They spot the Fire Wizard sitting atop his throne, the boy locked in a cage to his right. To reach him, the adventurers must cross an ornate stone bridge spanning across a raging river of magma, avoiding volleys of archers. They'll battle a lava giant and the Wizard himself.
villains: ['caveGnome', 'archer', 'goblin', 'rockElemental', 'lavaElemental', 'lavaGiant', 'fireWizard']
npcs: []
tips:
- Depending on the skill level of the adventurers, you may or may not choose to have the rope bridge collapse while they're on it.
- Before entering the subterranean palace, the adventurers might encounter a lone, terrified cave gnome who warns them of the dangers ahead. The gnome may optionally give them supplies to help them for the great battle they're about to face.

### The Volcano

{{%encounter order="a" title="Entrance to the Volcano" ability="" tips="" difficulty="" battle="" villains="" success="Beyond the opening of the cave, you spot a dark, winding tunnel. You can feel the heat of the volcano emanating from inside. You step into the tunnel." failure=""%}}
As you approach the base of the volcano, you come across the entrance to a cave.

The opening has been completely sealed up with hardened lava, and it appears to be pretty new. It also appears to have been sealed from the inside, rather than from lava cascading down the side of the volcano.

*How will you get inside?*

{{%encounter order="b" title="Lava Pond" ability="" tips="If they're hopping from rock-to-rock, have the players stop in the middle when they encounter a large gap." difficulty="" battle="" villains="" success="You start moving across the pond, headed toward the tunnel on the other side." failure=""%}}
As you move deeper into the volcano, you can feel the temperature rising. As you emerge around a bend in the tunnel, you come to a sudden stop.

Ahead of you is a giant pond of lava, dotted with small rocks. The tunnel continues on the other end of the pond.

*How will you get across?*

{{%encounter order="c" title="The Gap in the Lava Pond" ability="You notice some rocky protrusions in the cave wall that you might be able to hold onto or hook a rope on." tips="" difficulty="" battle="" villains="" success="You continue across the lava pond, and breath a sigh of relief as your feet touch the ground on the opposite side." failure=""%}}
Halfway across the pond, you encounter a large gap between the rocks. About 12 feet wide, it's too far to jump.

*How do you continue across the pond?*

{{%encounter order="d" title="Rope Bridge" ability="You notice that the bridge looks like its seen better days. The rope is thinning and frayed in places, and the wooden planks show signs of rot." tips="If too many players try to cross at once (or on an unsuccessful die roll), have the bridge start to collapse." difficulty="" battle="" villains="" success="Successfully across the bridge, you continue into the volcano." failure=""%}}
Continuing down the tunnel, you come to a rope bridge spanning a river of lava.
