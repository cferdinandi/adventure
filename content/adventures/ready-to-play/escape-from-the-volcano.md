premise: You're enjoying lunch at the tavern when the door slams open, and an old man with disheveled hair and a long, white beard rushes into the room. "My son!" he exclaims. "He's been taken by the Fire Wizard!"
details: The man is from the village on the other side of the Norther Mountains. The Fire Wizard was last seen disappearing with the boy into the tunnels underneath the giant volcano at the edge of their village.<br><br>The boy possesses a magical gift. If his hand is placed upon the Heart Stone located deep inside the volcano, it will cause it to erupt, burying the village in an ocean of lava.
intro: "This adventure follows a linear storyline."
storyline:
- The adventurers must break through the cave opening, which has been sealed with now-hardened lava.
- Next, they must navigate across a lava pond and reach the other side.
- The adventurers must cross an old rope bridge that traverses a river of magma. It's old, and rickety, and looks like it might fall at any moment.
- To keep moving forward, the adventurers need to either battle a rock elemental, or a hoard of cave gnomes.
- The adventurers fall through a trap door into a deep pit that begins filling with lava. They need to escape before it floods completely.
- They come to a long, straight hallway, dotted with ornate figurines along the walls. As they walk, the figurines intermittently shoot fire from their mouths across the hall.
- The tunnel opens up into a large lava lake, with two islands of rock connected by bridges. As they make their way across, they're attacked by unseen archers.
- The adventurers finally come to the entrance to the subterranean palace of the Fire Wizard. They must reach the top of a tiered plaza, fighting goblins, archers, a lava elemental, and a rock elemental.
- They spot the Fire Wizard sitting atop his throne, the boy locked in a cage to his right. To reach him, the adventurers must cross an ornate stone bridge spanning across a raging river of magma, avoiding volleys of archers. They'll battle a lava giant and the Wizard himself.
villains: ['caveGnome', 'archer', 'goblin', 'rockElemental', 'lavaElemental', 'lavaGiant', 'fireWizard']

tips:
- Depending on the skill level of the adventurers, you may or may not choose to have the rope bridge collapse while they're on it.
- Before entering the subterranean palace, the adventurers might encounter a lone, terrified cave gnome who warns them of the dangers ahead. The gnome may optionally give them supplies to help them for the great battle they're about to face.
