premise: Down in Farfaria Harbor, a bottle pops up from the depths. There's note rolled up inside, and a cork firmly pushed into the top. You fish the bottle from the Harbor, open it up, and read the note. A mermaid has been kidnapped!
details: The note is from Triton, king of the mermaids. "My daughter has been kidnapped by an evil sorcerer. If she's not rescued, the entire land of Farfaria is in grave danger."<br><br>"What's the danger," you wonder, "and where did the sorcerer take her?" It's up to you to rescue her.
intro: This is a complicated, linear storyline with three separate acts containing multiple critical encounters. There's also a lot more room for world exploration and side-encounters than some of the other adventures.
storyline:
- After learning about the mermaid's disappearance, adventurers must locate the sorcerer who took her. They'll eventually find him in the Castle of the North.
- After searching (and exploring) the castle, adventurers will locate the the sorcerer at the top of the East Tower. They attempt to fight him, but he escapes before the fight ends.
- Following cries for help, the go down to the dungeon. After locating the mermaid, she tells them that they must retrieve a magic key to break the enchantment on her prison door. She sends them to the dwarven mines in the Woods of the West.
- The dwarf that greets the adventurers tells them that in order to a forge a magic key, he needs the Torch of Hallows, which was hidden deep in the Cave of Monsters. They go in search of it.
- After battling the challenges of the cave and retrieving the torch, the dwarf forges the players a key, and they free the mermaid.
- The mermaid informs the adventurers that the sorcerer stole her magical shell, and will use it to unleash an army of sea creatures on Farfaria. She believes he's hiding in the Northern Mountains.
- After navigating the mountains and battling various creatures that live there, the adventurers have a final battle with the sorcerer in his mountain hideout.

npcs: ['The Old Man by the Sea', 'Mermaid', 'Knights', 'Townspeople', 'Centaur']
tips:
- The old man by the sea is actually a merfolk wizard who will reward adventurers with a special gift if they go on his side-adventure and retrieve the magical hook. Don't reveal this until the end.
- If adventurers don't immediately know where to look for the sorcerer and begin wandering Farfaria looking for him, the optional encounters *Centaurs and Spiders*, *Drops of Silver*, and *Elves of the Eastern Grove* all provide opportunities to be guided to the Castle of the North by non-player characters.
- In the Castle of the North, adventurers can steal/borrow, buy, or trade for food and supplies. You may or may not want to have them get caught if they steal something and have to evade capture.
- During the adventurers' first encounter with the Sorcerer, in the Castle of the North, the sorcerer should always get away. He's not intended to get caught yet.
- While story can carry on if adventurers skip the East Tower, the Sorcerer's escape creates a heightened sense of struggle and tension for the final battle.
- For battles involving numerous creatures, you can hold back some of the enemies and have them arrive as reinforcements after the initial wave is defeated, or you can send them in all at once to dial up the intensity.
- The tunnel system map contains some tunnels blocked by fallen rocks that lead to other parts of the tunnel system. They can be used in other adventures (where the rocks may or may not be cleared).
- Many of the maps have lots of side rooms and areas of exploration. You may wish to cover up the parts behind doors until after adventurers open them, revealing the world much in the same way adventurers would experience it in real life.
startingEncounter: Locate the Sorcerer
---

### 1. Farfaria Harbor

{{%encounter order="a" title="Locate the Sorcerer" tips="Players might use magical tools to find him. They could also ask the old man. Or, they could explore the region looking for him."%}}
You take a deep breath of ocean air, sigh, and look around. The village fisherman are already out to sea. An old man with a hat and a scraggly beard is leaning against the boathouse, staring off into the distance.

*Farfaria is large. The sorcerer and mermaid could be anywhere. How can you locate them?*
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="The Old Man by the Sea" optional="true" tips="No die roll is needed for this encounter. Players either agree to his terms, or they don't." success="The old man thanks you, and tells you that he saw the sorcerer head north with the mermaid, towards the Castle of the North. The castle looks small off in the distance. With no time to waste, you head north!" failure="You thank the old man for his time, and decide to try another approach." location="Farfaria Harbor" scenary="The Harbor"%}}
You approach the old man, who turns and looks at you with glass-blue eyes. "What can I do for you," he asks.

You tell him what the message in the bottle said, and ask if he's seen anything. He replies, "I did, but will cost you." "How much," you ask?

"A simple favor," he replies. "Along your travels, you may happen upon a giant crab. He hoards jewels and items of immense value. Among his collection is a magical hook. Retrieve it for me and bring it here. But beware, for he's very dangerous."

*Do you agree to his terms?*
{{%/encounter%}}

### 2. The Woods of the West

{{%encounter order="a" title="Centaurs and Spiders" optional="true" difficulty="-1" battle="Up to three adventurers: 4 Giant Spiders||Four or more adventurers: 6 Giant Spiders" success="With the spiders gone, the centaurs return to their homes. The centaur you first spoke with trots over, shakes your hand, and thanks you sincerely.<br><br>As a token of appreciation, he offers you a gift (the *Game Master* should choose a reward). You thank him and happily accept it.<br><br>*[If adventurers are not yet aware of the Castle of the North]* The centaur asks where you'll go next. You explain that you're looking for a sorcerer and the kidnapped mermaid. His eyes beam, and he explains that he saw them pass through earlier that day, headed towards the Castle of the North."%}}
A centaur gallops by, an urgent look on his face. "Is everything ok," you ask. "Not at all," he exclaims. "Our home has been overrun with giant spiders. Can you help?"

You look a short distance ahead and see about a dozen centaurs running away from their tent village, fearful looks on their faces.
{{%/encounter%}}

### 3. The Eastern Grove

{{%encounter order="a" title="Drops of Silver" optional="true" success="You follow the drops for a few minutes before coming to a small opening in the forest. You look up and let out a small gasp. Just ahead is a beautiful unicorn, one hoof stuck in a trap."%}}
As you make your way through the forest, you see drops of silver in the grass and leaves beneath your feet. They lead slightly off the path, between a small crop of trees.

*Do you follow them, or continue on?*
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="The Unicorn Trap" optional="true" success="The trap springs open. The unicorn puts weight on his leg and, after checking that he's not hurt, thanks you profusely.<br><br>*[If adventurers are not yet aware of the Castle of the North]* The unicorn asks where you were headed. You explain that you're looking for a sorcerer and the kidnapped mermaid. His eyes beam, and he explains that he saw them pass through earlier that day, headed towards the Castle of the North."%}}
You rush over to the unicorn and reassuringly pet his mane. "We'll get you out of here," you promise.

You look at the trap more closely. It's a chain attached to a stake, with a simple lock at the unicorns ankle.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="c" title="Elves of the Eastern Grove" optional="true" tips="If the adventurers say yes, provide them with a puzzle or brain teaser from outside of the game to complete." success="*[If adventurers are not yet aware of the Castle of the North]* The Elvish Guard tells you that she saw the sorcerer and mermaid that you seek pass through the woods earlier that day, headed towards the Castle of the North.<br><br>*[If the adventurers already know or have already gone]*You've proven yourselves worth. I'm happy to present you with a gift that will aid you on your journey (the *Game Master* should chose an item of value to the group)." failure="Unable to complete the task, the Elvish Guard wishes you luck and sends you on your way."%}}
Your path brings you through Elf territory. While friendly, they're cautious about who's in their forest, and why.

An Elvish Guard stands on the path ahead, spear in hand. She instructs you to stop, and asks why you're passing through the forest. You tell her where you're headed, and are permitted to pass.

"But before you go on," she adds, "we have something that may be helpful on your journey. We only share it with those considered worthy enough, however. Would you be interested in completing a challenge?"
{{%/encounter%}}

### 4. The Castle of the North

{{%encounter order="a" title="Entering the Castle of the North" tips="Players can try to talk to the people in the castle, or explore some of the rooms."%}}
The giant Castle of the North towers above you. Thankfully, the drawbridge is down. You cross it, and enter the castle courtyard. Knights and townspeople scurry about, busy with the day's tasks.

There are two doors on either side of the courtyard. In the back left and back right corners are two tall, spiraling towers that provide visibility and protection against the threats of the Northern Mountains. In the middle of the courtyard is a cart, a traveling shop run by a woman selling exotic objects and magical spells.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="Room 1" tips="The *Game Master* might choose to let adventurers discover useful items in the room."%}}
You walk through the door into the first room on the right. There's a table and chairs, and some maps on the wall. Clearly, this is a meeting space of some sort. To the left is a narrow hallway that leads to another room. The space is otherwise empty.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="c" title="Room 2" tips="The small drafty door in this room leads down to the dungeon, where they'll discover the mermaid. It's OK if they don't find this until later in the story." battle="Up to three adventurers: 3 Brooms||Four or more adventurers: 5 Brooms" success="The magical brooms successfully dealt with you, you look around and decide where to go next." failure="Unable to stop the brooms, you retreat to another space."%}}
The room appears to be a supply closet. There are some brooms and mops leaning against the wall in one corner, and a handful of buckets in another. A sink with water is against the wall between them.

Beyond the door back into the main courtyard and the hallway to the first room, there's another small door on the left. It's smaller, lower, and appears heavy. You feel a cold draft coming from beneath it.

Suddenly, the brooms stand upright and start marching towards the adventurers. Bits of their handles split off into tiny arms, which they use to pick up buckets. They attack the adventurers, swinging buckets of dirty water at them.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="d" title="Room 3" tips="Players may choose to take some food for their journey."%}}
As you walk in the door, you look around and see nothing but food. The whole is stacked floor to ceiling with bread, cured meats, and dried fruits.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="e" title="Room 4" tips="Players may choose to steal something, barter/sell items they already possess, or simply leave."%}}
As soon as the door opens, you hear the clinking of coins. Against he back wall is a table. Seated at it is a tiny goblin, with tall pointed ears and a hunch in his back, counting a massive pile of gold coins and noting them in a small journal. On either side are tall shelves stacked high with coins, jewels, and other objects of value.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="f" title="The Shop Cart" tips="Players may choose to buy something, or trade for an item they already have."%}}
You approach the shop owner, who waves her hands over her numerous wares with a flourish. "See anything of interest," she asks?
{{%/encounter%}}

### 5. The West Tower

{{%encounter order="a" title="An Empty Tower" tips="The *Game Master* may choose to scatter some useful items around the space. A map has been provided to allow for exploration if desired."%}}
You enter the tower, a narrow, three-story spire with a window on the top floor. You quickly search all three floors, and, aside from a few chairs and a desk, find it completely abandoned.
{{%/encounter%}}

### 6. The East Tower

{{%encounter order="a" title="The First Floor" tips="Players should use their skills and items to try to navigate the traps" difficulty="-1" success="You successfully avoid the traps, and make your way up the stairs." failure="After an arrow hidden in the wall whizzes by overhead, you decide to come back later. You step back into the courtyard."%}}
The moment you enter the tower, you sense that something is amiss. A dark, magical aura fills the first floor. You start to head for the stairs when something in your gut tells you that danger is near. You step back just a trap door at the base of the stairs swings open, dropping to a deep, dark pit.

The room is filled with traps.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="The Second Floor" battle="An Ogre" success="The ogre dealt with/avoided (for now), you dash up the stairs towards the third floor." failure="You retreat back down to the first floor, and consider your options."%}}
You barely get your head into the room when a giant wooden club slams into the stone wall overhead. A chair and a pile of rocks lie against the far wall. The stairs leading to the next floor are just ten feet away.

And an angry ogre is standing to one side of the stair case, staring at with angry eyes and foul breath.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="c" title="The Third Floor" tips="The adventurers never catch the sorcerer at this point. He disappears regardless of the action they take. If they fight him, he disappears mid-battle. *After this encounter, encourage adventurers to head to the dungeon.*" difficulty="-3" battle="The Sorcerer" success="Suddenly, a puff of a smoke fills the room. When it clears, the sorcerer is gone. You were so close!<br><br>You're unsure what to do next... until you hear a faint yell coming from the bottom of the stairs. You rush to the first floor, following the sound. That's when you see it: a small door on the side of the stairs that hadn't noticed before."%}}
As you rush up the stairs, you immediately see him: the sorcerer. There's a desk pressed against the wall, directly underneath a window, and a few magical trinkets around the room. The mermaid is nowhere to be seen.

The sorcerer raises his wand and fires a spell in your direction.
{{%/encounter%}}

### 7. The Dungeon

{{%encounter order="a" title="The Door to the Dungeon" tips="The *Game Master* should encourage the adventurers to head down the stairs."%}}
You open the door and peer into it. A narrow winding staircase leads down. You feel a damp, cold breeze blowing. The yelling gets louder. "Help! Help!"
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="Into the Dungeon" tips="Players may choose to unlock one of the doors, head down the small staircase, or retreat back upstairs"%}}
You make your way down a winding staircase and emerge inside a cold, gloomy, dank dungeon. To your right are a pair of keys, hanging from the wall. Straight ahead is a locked door. To your right, another one. Far to the left is a small staircase. The yells for help are echoing off the walls, making it hard to tell where they're coming from.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="c" title="Door 1" tips="Players might try to break the lock, or use one of the keys to unlock it." success="The centaur, bows, grateful for your help. He reaches into a satchel tied around his waist, and hands you a gift of thanks. He also warns you that not every creature trapped down here is friendly."%}}
The door is unlocked. You open it, and find a centaur, a chain tied around this leg. "Please help me," he says. You can still hear the cries for help. It wasn't him.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="d" title="Door 2" tips="Players can try to slam the door shut before the yeti gets out instead of fighting him, if they want." difficulty="-2" battle="Yeti" success="Now that you've handled the yet, you can get back to locating the source of the cries for help."%}}
You open the door, and a yeti immediately charges towards you.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="e" title="The Sunken Room" success="You promise the mermaid you'll return with the magic key. Then you turn, and head back up the stairs. Time to visit the mines."%}}
You head down the short staircase. At the bottom, you find another door. This one has a lock on the front, and bars allowing you to see in. Inside the room is the mermaid, the source of the cries for help.

You explain that you've been looking for her, and that you're here to get her out. "Thank you!" she exclaims. "But... this door is protected by a powerful enchantment, and only a magic key can unlock it. The dwarves who work the mines of the Western Woods know how to forge one."

*What do you say to the mermaid?*
{{%/encounter%}}

### 8. The Mines

In the tunnel, adventurers will approach various forks. Let them choose which way to go.

{{%encounter order="a" title="The Dwarf Miners"success="Reluctantly, you head over to the cave entrance, and take your first step inside."%}}
After a short journey, you arrive at the mines. A dwarf steps out to greet you, wearing a traditional red hat and long gray beard. He's gruff and direct, but not mean. "Why are you hear?" he asks.

You explain that you could use his help forging a magic key to free a mermaid that the sorcerer has trapped in the dungeon.

"I'd be happy to help," he explains, sounding very much *not* happy, "but a key of that nature can only be forged with fire from the Torch of Hallows..." Gesturing towards a smaller cave entrance off the left, he continues, "And that was stolen and hidden in the depths of the Cave of Monsters. I can only forget the key if you're brave enough to retrieve it."
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="The Ledge" tips="Every player must complete this challenge individually." success="With the entire group over the ledge, you continue down the tunnel."%}}
About 20 feet into the tunnel, you hit your first obstacle: a ledge.

It's about 12 feet high, with a rough face. Plenty of places to tuck hands and feet if you wanted to try to climb it. But if you fall, you could get hurt.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="c" title="The Hydra" difficulty="-1" battle="The Hydra" success="The hydra no longer a threat, you continue down the tunnel path."%}}
You enter a dark, cavernous space. It's about 30 feet wide and 20 feet high. A pile of fallen rocks sits against the wall to one side. Stalactites hang from the ceiling, and a stalagmites grow from the ground. You hear the drip of water.

Then you hear a low grow.

You look up to see three tiny flames glowing inside three bigger mouths on the faces of a three-headed hydra, who's clearly unhappy you're here.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="d" title="The Cliff" tips="Each player must complete this challenge individually. Resourceful adventurers might consider heading back out to the forest to get a fallen branch to use as a bridge." difficulty="-1" success="With the whole team successfully across, you continue on your way."%}}
You stop suddenly, put your arm out, and tell the rest of the group to back up slowly.

You've just come across a deep crevice plunging into the darkness. It's about ten feet from one side to the other, and there's a small ledge about five feet down on the far side.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="e" title="Wolves" battle="One or two adventurers: 3 wolves||Three or four adventurers: 5 wolves||Five or more adventurers: 7 wolves" villains="Wolf: Difficulty - 3, Health - 1" success="Not wanting to stick around, you take off at a run down the tunnel."%}}
Suddenly, you hear howling from the tunnel to your left. Wolves!
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="f" title="Underwater" tips="Players should try to get through the tunnel at the bottom. All adventurers must complete this challenge individually. To heighten tension, if some adventurers have made it and others have not yet, you can act as if the successful adventurers don't know what happened to the rest of their group." difficulty="-2" success="You're soaking wet and out of breath, but you made it. You keep walking into the darkness."%}}
You come to a murky pool of water. It looks to be about 15 feet deep. Directly ahead of you is a solid wall of rock.

Staring into the gloom, you notice what appears to be a small opening at the bottom of the pool, along the far wall. You don't know what's on the other side.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="g" title="The Giant Crab" difficulty="-2" battle="A Giant Crab" success="With the terrifying crab out of the way, you race out of the room and down the next tunnel. (*If applicable, don't forget to grab the hook.*)"%}}
You enter another cavernous room. Bioluminescent algae casts a blue/green glow into the space, which reflects off the giant rock in the middle of the room. Towards the back of the cavern are gold coins, jewels, and what appear to be magical artifacts.

(*For adventurers who opted into the Old Man of the Sea's quest, among those artifacts is a magical hook.*)

Suddenly, the giant rock in the middle of the room shakes and rises. You see spindly protrusions emerge from underneath it, and it turns around. Two dotted eyes start at you. That's when you notice the giant claws hanging off the front of this monster. It's a giant crab!
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="h" title="The Torch of Hallows" tips="There's no die roll for this encounter. One adventurers find it, they can leave." success="Now that you have the torch, there's only one thing left to do: get back out!"%}}
You see the glowing flame reflecting off the wall before you even enter the room. As you step into the space, you see it: the Torch of Hallows.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="i" title="Another Entrance" tips="There's no die roll for this encounter. Players either leave this way or head back into the cave." success="You instinctively squint your eyes as you emerge from the dark cave into the brilliant daylight. A quick look around confirms what you suspected: you're nowhere near where you started. You can see the Northern Mountains off in the distance. You're near the bottom of the Woods of the West. Time to head North!"%}}
A short distance ahead, you see an unmistakable sight: daylight. This isn't the way you entered the cave, but going back the way you came means facing monsters anew.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="j" title="Forging of the Key" tips="There's no die roll for this encounter. Players deliver the Torch of Hallows to the dwarf, who forges their key." success="The dwarf thanks you, and explains that the Torch has a long history with his people, and was stolen several years ago (but that's another tale for another time). He forges you a magical key, and wishes you luck on the rest of your journey."%}}
The sight of the gruff dwarf's face is a welcome one. He doesn't look happy to see you (or the Torch) exactly, but it's the closest you've seen him come to a smile since you arrived.

You hand him the torch.
{{%/encounter%}}

### 9. Back to the Dungeon

{{%encounter order="a" title="Freeing the Mermaid" success="The mermaid overheard the sorcerer talking with someone about a hideout in the Northern Mountains."%}}
You insert the magical key into the lock, and wave a green washes over the door, blasting outward and knock you all to the floor.

You stand up, dust yourself off, and look around. The key has disappeared, and the door has swung open. You rush over to the mermaid. She's uninjured, and glad to be free. She thanks you profusely for your help.

She tells you that she actually *walked* here. She possesses a magical shell that allows her to walk on land as a human.

The sorcerer stole it, and plans to use it to summon an aquatic army and take over the kingdom. She begs you to get it back. "The fate of Farfaria depends on it."
{{%/encounter%}}

### 10. The Mountain Pass

{{%encounter order="a" title="The Entrance to the Pass"%}}
On either side of you are tall mountain peaks, topped in snow. Directly ahead is a narrow, winding path into the mountains. You head in.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="Goblin Attack" battle="One or two adventurers: 3 Goblins||Three or four adventurers: 2 Goblins, 2 Goblin Warrior||Five or more adventurers: 3 Goblins, 3 Goblin Warriors" success="The goblins no longer a threat, you continue down the mountain pass"%}}
As you round the first bend in the pass, a flaming arrow lands in the dirt near your feet. Goblins!
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="c" title="Cyclops" tips="If adventurers fled the goblins, they may find themselves stuck between them and the cyclops. Savvy adventurers can use the cyclops' single eye to their advantage." difficulty="-2" battle="Up to three adventurers: 1 Cyclops||Four or more adventurers: 2 Cyclops" success="You run out of the mountain pass, hoping you never have to face a cyclops again. Ahead is a lush valley nestled between mountain peaks, divided by a wide, turbulent river. Ahead, you seen the crumbling ruins of a former outpost."%}}
You see the end of the pass just ahead. Suddenly, a giant boulder flies overhead, crashing into the rocks behind you and shattering into pieces. Through the trees you spot him: a cyclops. He's not happy.
{{%/encounter%}}

### 11. The Hideout

{{%encounter order="a" title="The Bridge" tips="In addition to the tools and skills they already have, the surrounding area has many resources they can use to help them cross the river." difficulty="-1" success="Safely across (barely), you head into the crumbling ruins of the outpost."%}}
You approach the former outpost. "Could this be where the sorcerer is hiding out," you wonder to yourself? "Only one way to find out!"

You look down, and notice that the bridge is in a horrible state of disrepair.

Many of the wooden planks are rotted. You're not sure they'll hold your weight. Others are missing entirely. The entire structure is listing to the right, victim to erosion and the forces of nature.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="The Apprentices" tips="" difficulty="-3" battle="Up to three adventurers: 3 Apprentices||Four or more adventurers: 6 Apprentices" success="The room secured, you notice a door you hadn't seen before. Thick vegetation grew down from what was left of the rotting ceiling, blocking most of it from view. You look at the hinges, and notice fresh metal underneath, where the grime was scraped off from someone opening the door."%}}
You step through the collapsed entryway and glance around. The room smells of wet earth and decay.

Directly ahead of you is what's left of a stone wall. To the left, another half-collapsed wall. In the back corner is what was perhaps a closet or supply room.

From behind the wall in front of you, a sorcerer's apprentice steps out and launches a fireball in your direction.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="c" title="Behind the Door" tips="The only option for this challenge is to battle. The sorcerer disappears after being defeated. It's unclear if he's *gone* gone or just vanished to return in a future adventure." difficulty="-3" battle="The Sorcerer" success="As the final strike finds its target, the sorcerer's robes collapse to the floor in a pile. You run over and push them aside. He's gone. You rush over to the chest and open it. Inside is a gorgeous shell, a swirling mix of turquoise and coral-pink. You did it!"%}}
Ready for anything, you open the door. The room is big. There's a table and chairs to one side. On the other, the sorcerer. Behind him is a chest, the lid closed. He draws his wand.
{{%/encounter%}}

### Conclusion

When you arrive at the harbor, Triton is at the surface, sitting on the back of a narwhal. The mermaid is with him. You walk to the edge of the dock and hand him the shell.

"Thank you," he begins, "for returning my daughter, and the Shell of Atlantis. You've spared Farfaria a terrible fate at the hands of the sorcerer. I cannot thank you enough."

**If adventurers opted into the Old Man of the Sea's side-adventure:** The old man has been sitting silently at the end of the dock. With barely a splash, he slides into the water.

You gasp and run over. He pops back up but a moment later, transformed. His skin is greenish-blue, his beard a beautiful lavender, his eyes, still glass-blue, but alert and piercing.

"As you may have guessed," he said, "I'm a merfolk wizard. Were you able to retrieve the magical hook?"

- **If the adventurers were successful:** "Thank you! We had believed this lost for good."
- **If not:** "You certainly had more important things to focus on. Perhaps another quest for another day."

*__Note:__ The Game Master should choose appropriately awesome rewards for completing these adventures.*
