premise: A fairy wakes you from your sleep, begging for your help. She explains that ice from the north froze and killed their pixie dust tree. Without, she and the rest of her village will never fly again.
details: The fairy tells you that the Elder Fairy of the northern forest knows how to get a new pixie dust tree. She cannot go with you, as she does not have enough pixie dust to make the journey and is very tired. It's up to you to find him. She provides you with a compass to help you find your way.
intro: "This story follows a relatively linear storyline. It's a great choice for beginners."
storyline:
- The adventurers locate the Elder Fairy and go speak with him. He shares the secret to creating a new pixie dust tree... but it requires items from around Farfaria.
- The adventurers must decide if they want to go get more pixie dust from the Hunter Fairies first, or get water from the Sacred Stream.
- The Hunter Fairies aren't sure if the adventurers are good or bad and attack them. Players must defend themselves without harming the fairies.
- The Sacred Stream is filled with piranhas, and the surrounding woods are dangerous. They need to collect water without getting bit, and avoiding being caught.
villains:
- Pirate||2||1||3
- Pirate Captain||4||2||4
npcs: ['Fairies']
tips:
- Depending on the skill level of your players, you may need to suggest that they ask the Elder Fairy where they can find more pixie dust, or have a non-player character step in to guide them to the Hunter Fairies.

### 2. The Woods of the West

{{%encounter order="a" title="A Rocky Cliff" optional="true"%}}
You're making great progress, when your path suddenly ends in front of a steep, rocky cliff. It’s too high to climb with your bare hands, but it’s also the only way to get where you’re going.
{{%/encounter%}}

{{%encounter order="b" title="The Elder Fairy" success="The Elder Fairy provides you with the secret recipe: 3 grains of blue dust, 1 grain of yellow. Heat in a pot, stir, and allow to cool into a seed. Plant in the ground, and pour water from the Sacred Stream to grow a new pixie dust tree."%}}
As you approach a small cabin in middle of the forest, the Elder Fairy emerges.

You tell him why you're there, and he wants to help. But first, he needs to make sure you don't plan to use the fairy dust for your own personal gain.

*How can you prove to him that you are truly helping the fairies and not trying to steal the dust for yourself?*

{{%encounter order="c" title="Locate More Pixie Dust" tips="Players might try using tools like a Magic Map, use tracking skills, or ask for help." success="The players learn that there's a tribe of Hunter Fairies near the mountains in the Eastern Grove who have more pixie dust."%}}

### 3. The Eastern Grove

{{%encounter order="a" title="The Hunter Fairies" difficulty="-1" success="The fairies are overwhelmed by your kindness towards their species. They give a small pouch filled with pixie dust&mdash;three blue grains and one yellow. They also warn you that the forest can be dangerous."%}}
As you approach the border where the forest meets the mountains, you enter the territory of the Hunter Fairies. They have a healthy pixie dust tree, but think you’re dangerous and try to attack you. They're an important part of the ecosystem, so you don't want to harm them.

*How do you prove that you’re a friend, and protect yourself, without harming them?*

{{%encounter order="b" title="Pirate Thieves!" optional="true" tips="Players can stand their ground and fight, or run away to safety" difficulty="-1" battle="One or two players: 3 pirates, 1 captain||Three to four players: 4 pirates, 1 captain||Five or more players: 6 pirates, 1 captain" success="Still in possession of your pixie dust, you continue on to your next destination." failure="You slowly recover from the attack as the pirates run off with your supply of pixie dust. Now, you have to choose: chase after them and try to get it back, or return to the village of the Hunter Fairies and beg for more?" %}}
As you make your way toward your next destination, you hear rustling in the leaves to your left. Suddenly, a band of pirates emerges from the dark forest.

They've heard that you’re in possession of pixie dust, and want it for themselves. They attack you and try to steal the pixie dust.

### 4. The Sacred Stream

{{%encounter order="a" title="The Sacred Stream" difficulty="-1" success="With water from the Sacred Stream safely in hand, you move on quickly. You don't want to be around the piranha (or in pirate territory) any longer than you have to."%}}
Just beyond the trees, you hear the rushing water of the Sacred Stream. You step out into the light, reach down towards the water excitedly.

But before your hand touches the water, you catch sight of the hungry piranha's swimming just below the surface and pull your hand back. You cannot kill them, as they’re an important part of the ecosystem. But you can’t reach in to get water or they’ll bite you.

*How can you get water from the stream without getting hurt?*

### Conclusion

After swinging back to the Village to get your fairy friend, you arrive in Pixie Hollow with the pixie dust and water from the sacred stream.

You prepare the dust, plant the seed, and pour water onto it. The dusty swirls and turns a rainbow of colors. When the dusty settles, a new pixie tree sapling has emerged, and pixie dust is already starting to form on its small leaves.

Over the next few days, it will grow into a mature tree. The fairies are saved!
