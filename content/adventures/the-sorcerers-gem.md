A mysterious noble offers you a large sum of gold to retrieve a legendary gem for him. But he's not the only one looking for the gem. Can you navigate the many subterranean perils inside the Cave of Mysteries, and make it home safely before trouble finds you?

## The Situation

Lord Bertrand Kraghammer doesn't often leave his regal mansion (or have guests). In fact, no one in town is really sure what he does or what it looks like. So when he sent a messenger to invite you over for tea, you eagerly accepted.

He sits before you, teacup held delicately in his meaty fingers. You sip your tea in anticipation, waiting for him to talk. Finally, he speak...

> I have an important mission that requires adventurers of a certain... pedigree. Brave. Strong. Discrete.
>
> You may have heard stories about "the Sorcerer's Gem," a magic purple jewel that once belonged to the powerful Sorcerer Fenton Stormcloud, lost under mysterious circumstances?
>
> Many think that the tale is just that, a story. But I have reason to believe that it's real. My sources tell me that the Gem may be hidden deep within the Cave of Mysteries, within the Dark Forest.
>
> I'd like you to find the Gem, retrieve it, and return it to me. And I'm willing to pay handsomely.

Reaching into a pocket inside his jacket, Lord Graghammer produces the largest sack of gold you've ever seen, and drops it onto the table in front of you with a long _plonk_.

## Game Master Tips

- There are a few ways you can sequence certain events in this adventure. I would recommend...
	+ Giving the players the sense they're being followed in the woods.
	+ Having the elves approach them to warm them that it's dangerous, ask them why they're there, and then ask for an alliance.
	+ Have wolves ambush them while talking to the elves. The elves help them fight.
	+ Enter the tunnels, find the gem, and so on.
	+ Have the elves double cross the players while still in the tunnels.
	+ Have the wolves attack again once out, get saved by goblins, who also try to steal the Gem.
	+ Find and free the lizardfolk, who then turn on the players.
- This adventure can be quite long. You might want to break it up over several sessions, or cut out the storylines with the goblins and elves
