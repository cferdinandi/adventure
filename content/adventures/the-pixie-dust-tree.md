As you approach the border where the forest meets the mountains, you enter the territory of the Hunter Fairies. They have a healthy pixie dust tree, but think you’re dangerous and try to attack you. They're an important part of the ecosystem, so you don't want to harm them.

Just beyond the trees, you hear the rushing water of the Sacred Stream. You step out into the light, reach down towards the water excitedly.

But before your hand touches the water, you catch sight of the hungry piranha's swimming just below the surface and pull your hand back. You cannot kill them, as they’re an important part of the ecosystem. But you can’t reach in to get water or they’ll bite you.

You're making great progress, when your path suddenly ends in front of a steep, rocky cliff. It’s too high to climb with your bare hands, but it’s also the only way to get where you’re going.

## Conclusion

{{%conclusion location="" scenary="Forest" item="An earth spell you can use to move rocks and earth as needed"%}}
You arrive in Pixie Hollow with your fairy friend, pixie dust, and water from the sacred stream.

You prepare the dust, plant the seed, and pour water onto it. The dusty swirls and turns a rainbow of colors. When the dusty settles, a new pixie tree sapling has emerged, and pixie dust is already starting to form on its small leaves.

Over the next few days, it will grow into a mature tree. The fairies are saved!
