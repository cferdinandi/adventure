## The Situation

A fairy wakes you from your sleep, begging for your help. She explains that ice from the north froze and killed their pixie dust tree. Without, she and the rest of her village will never fly again.

## Locations

- **Elder Fairy Cabin.** A small cabin in the the middle of the woods where _The Elder Fairy_ lives. He's several centuries old, and knows the secret to creating more pixie dust fairy. He may have some supplies to help the adventurers.
- **The Northern Cliffs.** The path you're traveling on ends at a steep wall of rock. There's evidence that others have scaled it before, but it looks daunting from down on the ground.
- **The Eastern Grove.** The mysterious forests of the east are home to another group of fairies that, unlike the ones who approached you, avoid contact with the outside world. They are in possession of a working pixie dust tree.
- **The Sacred Stream.** A fast moving river, the waters of the sacred stream having magical properties and can be used for many things. They're also home to piranha and other dangerous creatures.

## Game Master Tips

- If you're unsure where to take this adventure, I like to have the Elder Fairy give players instructions on making a new tree: three grains of blue pixie dust with water from the Sacred Stream. Heat it over a fire for 15 minutes, then dig a hole and pour it into it. A new pixie dust tree will sprout. This sends them to two of the other locations on the map.
- I like to make the Fairies of the Eastern Grove hesitant to trust or work with the players. They must earn their trust somehow.
