## The Situation

As you're enjoying a nice breakfast down by the harbor, a massive geyser of water erupts a hundred feet into the air.

A powerful sorcerer surrounded by an arcane bubble rises to the surface, holding a mermaid captive. Her necklace, the legendary _Conch of Calling_, glitters as it catches the sun. With a wave of the sorcerer's hand, a swirly portal of bluish-purple light opens up near the shore. As the pair zip through it, it snaps closed behind them with a loud boom.

A moment later, Triton, the king of the mermaids, rises to the surface. He locks eyes with you and shouts:

> “My daughter has been kidnapped. If she’s not rescued, your entire world is in grave danger.”

Then he disappears beneath the waves without another word. It’s up to you to rescue her... before it's too late.



## Questions

- What legends have you heard about _Conch of Calling_? What does it allegedly do?
- Who is the sorcerer, and where did he come from?
- You've heard rumors that a powerful group of wizards has been gathering. Where are they rumored to meetup?
- What do you know about the merpeople?
- What other magical creatures live in the area?



## Locations

- **The Castle of the North.** The giant Castle of the North towers above you. Thankfully, the drawbridge is down. You cross it, and enter the castle courtyard. Knights and townspeople scurry about, busy with the day’s tasks... but something seems off.
- **The Castle Dungeon.** A dark, smelly labyrinth of hallways and jail cells. Various creatures locked up, many proclaiming their innocence. Several cells locked with magical means and cannot be open with keys or lock-pick sets.
- **Mines of the Mountain.** An ancient mine run by a community of dwarfs. They're reclusive but friendly. An ancient Torch of Hollows is lost in the mines, and has the power to forge powerful magic items. But beware! Many a mythical creature resides inside the tunnels.
- **The Mountain Pass.** A steep, winding, dangerous mountain pass that leads through goblin and cyclops villages.
- **The Mountain Hideout.** A former mountain outpost where a sorcerer and his minions are now hiding. There’s a rotting bridge traversing a rapidly moving stream that leads to the front entrance. The walls are crumbling, and the building is in heavy disrepair.



## Creatures & Traps

- **The Sorcerer.** Took the mermaid, then stole the _Conch of Calling_ and headed off to the mountains.
- **Enchanted Brooms & Mops.** Normal looking brooms or mops spring to life to attack and provide simple defenses to areas people don't want explored.
- **Magical Lock.** The mermaid's cell can only be unlocked with a special key forged by dwarves in the Mines of the Mountain.
- **Underwater Tunnel.** A murky pool of water, about 15 feet deep. Directly ahead of you is a solid wall of rock. Staring into the gloom, you notice what appears to be a small opening at the bottom of the pool, along the far wall.
- **Hydra.** Has multiple heads that grow back after several turns. Spits acid.
- **Wolves.** A pack of wolves runs wild in the caverns. They're led by a werewolf, cursed years ago by the same sorcerer who kidnapped the mermaid.
- **Giant Crab.** The size of a car, he looks like a boulder when at rest. His powerful claws can crush pretty much anything.
- **Goblins.** A horde of goblins patrol the pass and shakedown travelers for gold and jewels.
- **Cyclops.** Angry and territorial, they'll strike first even if left alone.
- **Rock Slide.** The mountain pass is treacherous, and rock slides are a common occurrence. They goblins have nothing to do with it. They promise!



## Secrets

- The sorcerer has been using the castle as a second hideout. There's clear evidence he's been here. People know of him but are afraid to say much more.
- The mermaid is being held captive in the castle dungeon.
