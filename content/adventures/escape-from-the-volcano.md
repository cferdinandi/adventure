Can you stop a powerful sorcerer before he awakens a dormant volcano and destroys the village at its base?

<div data-toc="In This Adventure"></div>



## The Situation

You've just sat down to each lunch in Farfaria Tavern when a man bursts through the door, out-of-breath with wild, frantic eyes.

> My child, my child! Someone please help.

The man tells you that his name is Mercer Skiprock. He's from a small town in the valley on the other side of the Northern Mountains.

> Lorak the Sorcerer has taken my child to his lair inside Meltinstone Volcano. The volcano has been dormant for centuries, but we're now in grave in danger.

He leans in, eyes still wild with nervous energy, and whispers...

> My child, Zephyr, possesses a gift&mdash;or a curse, depending on how you look at it&mdash;that can awaken the volcano. If it erupts, it will destroy my village and unleash the dark forces that live within. We cannot let that happen!

He places a small sack of gold on the table.

> I don't have much, but will you help rescue my child... and save our village?

	+ If the party begins to win, he casts a spell that causes the cavern to begin collapsing, and flees. The party must rescue Zephyr and escape before the whole mountain collapses.

	+ Lorak the Sorcerer

## Game Master Tips

- If you want to make the campaign more difficult or longer, you can have Lorak the Sorcerer awaken the volcano before the players have a chance to stop them. This will create an additional side-campaign: stopping the volcano from destroying the village.
