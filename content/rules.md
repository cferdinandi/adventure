In Adventure, players work together to overcome challenges, battle ferocious monsters, explore new worlds, discover hidden treasures, and, hopefully, save the day.

<div data-toc="Table of Content"></div>



## How It Works

The game follows a simple pattern.

1. The _Game Master_ (or _GM_, the person running the game) describes a situation.
2. The player or players state what they want to do.
3. The GM describes what happens.

The most important phrase in Adventure is, "What do you do?"

{{<callout title="Example">}}
**GM:** "Before you lies a bridge. There are boards missing in places, and the ones that remain appear old and rotted. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to walk across, carefully checking for loose boards as I go."

**GM:** "As you're walking across, one of the boards starts to break under your feet. As you scramble across, the entire bridge begins to collapse. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to jump to the other side before the whole bridge falls down."

**GM:** "You push off the breaking board with all of your might, catching the ledge with your fingers and hoisting yourself over the edge. The bridge falls into the chasm below you. But as you do, your sword falls out of your hilt and drops onto a ledge about 20 feet down. What do you do?"
{{</callout>}}



## What You Need to Play

1. **Dice.** Adventure uses a single six-sided die (_or a D20 if you'd prefer_). If you don't have any dice, you can [roll digital dice](/dice/).
2. **Character sheets.** You can print them out from [the downloads page](/downloads) or just write the details down in a notebook.
3. **Your imagination.** The most important part!

You might want to keep a pen and notebook handy, but it's not at all required to play.



## Creating a Character

Every player creates a character to play in the game.

The [downloads section](/downloads) includes printable character sheets to guide you through the process, as well as premade characters. You'll reference them throughout the game.

_Players may want to use a toy, figurine, or paper cut-out to represent their character while they play._

Name & Description
: You can be anyone you want to be in adventure: an elf wizard, a fairy tinkerer, a space cowboy, a dragonfly spy. Be anything you want.

Health
: Every player starts with 10 _Health Points (HP)_. This is your _Max HP_. Throughout the game, your HP will up and down as things happen.

Specialty
: Your character may be good at a few things, but they specialize in one: _Strength_, _Dexterity_, or _Wisdom_. The thing you specialize in will help you complete certain types of tasks.
	- _Strength._ Athletics, Intimidation, Feats of Strength
	- _Dexterity._ Acrobatics, Speed, Stealth, Slight of Hand
	- _Wisdom._ Perceiving, Knowing, Figuring Things Out

Armor
: Does your character wear armor? If so, you'll take less damage, but will have a harder time with tasks that require _Dexterity_. Your _Armor Level_ is how skilled you are at using armor to protect yourself. Every player starts with an _Armor Level_ of 1.

Attack Damage
: When your character uses weapons, magic, or even their hands, they cause damage. _Attach Damage_ represents how powerful they are. Every player starts with an _Attack Damage_ (or _AD_) number of 4.

Features
: What makes your character unique? Do they have a special skill, like fire breathing or the ability to fly? Are they a really good swimmer? Can they make themselves invisible or fly?

Gear & Treasure
: You start the game with a simple weapon, wand, or tool; a travelers pack; and one healing potion. Magical characters should have a few simple spells. In your adventures, you may find, buy, or earn more cool stuff.



## Rolling Dice

For most player actions, what happens is decided by rolling dice (either a D6 or D20, your choice).

| D6  | Outcome                                  | D20   |
|-----|------------------------------------------|-------|
| 6   | Success. It worked as planned.           | 18-20 |
| 3-5 | Partial Success. It worked, with a cost. | 9-17  |
| 2-  | Failure. It didn't work.                 | 8-    |

{{<callout title="Example">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>The player is trying to convince a wealthy noble that they're a distant relative.</strong> The noble isn't very trusting. They roll a D20.</p>

- On 18 or above, the noble believes them, offering them a room in their palace and a feast in their honor.
- On a 9 to 17, the noble reluctantly believes them, but secretly sends someone to look into their background.
- On an 8 or less, the noble becomes angry, and has them arrested.
{{</callout>}}

_You can choose not to require a die roll. Ask for a roll any time you want to add chance to an outcome._

### Best Roll & Worst Roll

Items, special skills, and circumstances may give the player an advantage or disadvantage in attempting to complete a task.

<p class="margin-bottom-small">Adventure uses <em>Best Roll (BR)</em> and <em>Worst Roll (WR)</em> to account for that.</p>

- **Best Roll.** Roll two dice and take the higher number.
- **Worst Roll.** Roll two dice and take the lower number.

If the player has a specialty, feature, or tool that would aid them in their task, they can use Best Roll. If a condition would make it harder for them, they use Worst Roll.

If a player would get both Best Roll _and_ Worst Roll, they cancel each other out.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Best Roll
: The player is attempting to sneak up on a camp and surprise them. Their specialty is Dexterity. The Game Master tells them to use Best Roll.

Worst Roll
: An evil wizard uses a spell to shroud the cavern in darkness, and the player cannot see them. They attempt to shoot an arrow at wizard through the darkness. The Game Master tells them to use Worst Roll.

Both
: The player who's trying to sneak up on the camp is also wearing armor, which gives them Worst Roll on Dexterity tasks. This cancels out the Best Roll from their specialty in Dexterity. They roll one die.
{{</callout>}}

### Wisdom Checks

There may be information that the Game Master want to reveal to players selectively.

For example, when approaching the area where the thieves are going to attack, the Game Master can ask the players to roll a _Wisdom Check_. Any players who have a successful roll “hear the thieves approaching” and have a chance to take action before the attack.

The Game Master can also call for Wisdom Checks if the players ask for information about their environment that in real would depend on their own awareness of their surroundings or prior knowledge. For example, “Do I see anything out of the ordinary?”

_Players who specialize in Wisdom take Best Roll on Wisdom Checks._

{{<callout title="Example">}}
The players find a mysterious, glowing rock deep in a cavern. It pulses green. The cavern is surprisingly quiet. The players ask,

> "What is this? What does it do?"

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>The Game Master asks for a Wisdom Check, and the player rolls a D20.</strong></p>

- On an 8 or lower, they can tell it's magical, but know nothing about it's specific properties or uses.
- On a 9 to 17, the GM tells them that they've heard rumors of a magical gem that belonged to the sorcerer of the North. It was stolen from him some years ago, and he's been looking for it every since. They don't know what it does, only that it's very valuable.
- On an 18 or higher, the GM also tells them that it's rumored to be able to bring trees to life, if you know the right magical phrase, and can be used to create a powerful army of treefolk.
{{</callout>}}

### Spellcasting

For characters that know magic, casting spells works just like any other action. When casting a spell, players roll dice to see if it works or not.

<p class="margin-bottom-small">There are two exceptions to this:</p>

- **For really simple spells** that aren't directly working towards a challenge (for example, lighting a campfire, or making an object glow to provide light), the Game Master can choose to skip the die roll.
- **For really powerful spells**, the Game Master may choose to limit them in some way. Maybe they can only be cast once per day, or they require a special, rare item (like a phoenix feather) to use.

### Combat

While much of Adventure is focused on exploring and problem solving, you can introduce combat with monsters as a way to keep things interesting.

<p class="margin-bottom-small">Combat in Adventure works just like any other player action.</p>

- The player says what they want to do, and rolls dice
- The GM describes what happens as a result

<p class="margin-bottom-small">If the player has a specialty in...</p>

- _Strength_, take Best Roll on up-close/melee attacks and blocking defense.
- _Dexterity_, take Best Roll on distanced/ranged attacks and dodging defense.
- _Wisdom_, take Best Roll on magical attacks and defense.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
**The player is trying to hit an ogre with their sword.** This is a feat of strength. They roll a D20.

- On 18 or above, the sword hits, causing the ogre to scream and stumble back a few feet.
- On a 9 to 17, the sword hits, but the ogre swings at them at the same time slams its fist into their shoulder.
- On an 8 or less, the sword misses, slamming into the ground beside the ogre.

**A troll throws a giant boulder at the player, and they attempt to jump out of the way.** This requires dexterity, which the player specializes in. They roll two D20, and take Best Roll.

- On an 18 or above, the jump out of the way, and the boulder bounces off into the distance.
- On a 9 to 17, they leap out of the way, but the boulder catches their sword and knocks it 20 feet away.
- On an 8 or less, the boulder slams into them before they can jump out of the way.
{{</callout>}}

### Fleeing a Battle

Every now and then, players may find themselves in a battle they just can't win.

Players can choose to flee a battle at any time, including in the middle of one. The Game Master may require a roll to determine what happens.

### Teamwork

Adventure is a cooperative, team game. The more you work together, the more likely you are to succeed.

- **For group tasks**, like trying to cross a river or sneak into a castle, if at least half of the party succeeds, everyone does.
- **For individual tasks**, if you can reasonably assist a teammate, they get _Best Roll_.

{{<callout title="Example">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small">A three-person party is trying to sneak into the castle undetected. The Game Master asks for a roll. Because this involves stealth, players who specialize in Speed take Best Roll.</p>

- If all three players make their roll, the party succeeds.
- If one player fails and two succeed, the party still succeeds.
- If two players fail, but one succeeds, they all fail.
{{</callout>}}



## Health & Damage

As an adventurer, you’re going to take damage from time-to-time. Cuts, bruises, and serious injury are a common risk.

### Health Points

Every character and creature has a pool of _Health Points_ (or _HP_). Health Points represent a creature's overall health.

Whenever a character or creature takes damage, points are subtracted from their Current HP. When their HP reaches 0, they’re knocked out, and remain that way until another party member revives them.

_Players start with a Max HP of 10. A character’s Current HP can never exceed their Max HP._

{{<callout title="Example">}}
A player has a Current HP of 7. They fall and take 2 points of damage. Their Current HP is now 5.
{{</callout>}}

### Attack Damage

Every character and monster has an _Attack Damage_ (or _AD_) number that specifies how much damage their successful attacks cause.

On a successful weapon or spell attack, subtract their AD from the attacked creature's HP. On an unarmed attack (just their hands or feet), subtract half their AD instead.

On a _Partial Success_ roll, the GM can choose to halve the _Attack Damage_ as a cost.

_Players start with an AD of 4._

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
<p class="margin-bottom-small">For each example, assume an <em>Attack Damage</em> number of 4.</p>

- **A knight hits a hydra with her sword.** The hydra loses 4 HP.
- **A wizard, out of spells, elbows the goblin that's holding him captive.** The goblin loses 2 HP.
- **A fighter rolls a _Partial Success_ while trying to hit a troll with his spear.** The spear grazes the troll's shoulder. It loses 2 HP.
{{</callout>}}

### Armor

Armor and shields provide protection against attacks.

When a character or creature receives damage while wearing armor, they subtract their _Armor Level_ from the damage received before subtracting it from their HP.

Protection from armor and shields only applies once. You cannot, for example, wear armor _and_ a shield and double your protection.

_While wearing armor or holding a shield, characters also take Worst Roll on Dexterity rolls. Players start with an Armor Level of 1._

{{<callout title="Example">}}
A troll hits you with a club, doing 7 points of damage. You're wearing armor and have an Armor Level of 1. You subtract 6 points from your HP.
{{</callout>}}

### Healing

When a player's HP reaches 0, they're knocked out and cannot continue to fight until they have at least 1 HP.

<p class="margin-bottom-small">Fortunately, players can heal in a few ways.</p>

- If you _take a rest_, you can recover your Attack Damage number of HP
- Using tools like bandages or healing potion

When you heal, add the amount of HP healed back to your Current HP (up to your Max HP). Your Current HP cannot exceed your Max HP.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Healing with Rest
: Your Current HP is 3, and your Attack Damage number is 4. After a rest, your new Current HP is 7.

Healing with Potion
: Your Current HP is 6, and your Max HP is 10. You drink a Healing Potion, which heals 7 HP of damage. Since your Max HP is 10, your new Current HP is 10. The extra 1 HP of healing is lost.
{{</callout>}}

### Immunity & Vulnerability

<p class="margin-bottom-small">There are different types of damage.</p>

- **Bludgeoning.** From falls and blunt force attacks with things like hammers and staffs
- **Slashing.** From swords, spears, claws, and teeth
- **Fire.** From fire and lava, natural or magical
- **Lightning.** From lightning and electricity, natural or magical
- **Cold.** From ice, snow, and cold temperatures, natural or magical
- **Acid.** From chemicals and toxic substances
- **Magic.** From magical forces like energy blasts and radiant light

<p class="margin-bottom-small">Some creatures (and players) have immunity or vulnerability to certain types of damage.</p>

- **Immune.** Take no damage for damage of this type
- **Vulnerable.** Double damage from damage of this type

{{<callout title="Examples">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small">The player hits two creatures with a fireball.</p>

- **The Dragon has _Immune: Fire_.**  It takes no damage.
- **The Ice Monster has _Vulnerable: Fire._** It takes double damage.
{{</callout>}}



## Leveling Up

As your character goes on adventures, they’ll gain new experiences and pick up new skills. Whenever the party does something particularly meaningful or awesome, the GM should level up the party.

**When you level up...**

- Increase your _Health Points_ by +5
- Increase your _Attack Damage_ by +3
- Increase your _Armor Level_ by +1
- Pick-up 1 or 2 new skills, spells, weapons, or magic items (at the GM's discretion)

If you want, you can use the same character from one adventurer to the next, and bring their skills, gear, and treasure along with them.



## House Rules

House rules are strongly encouraged in Adventure. Here are some ideas you may want to adapt to your game.

### Pets

For added fun, characters can have a pet that accompanies them on their adventures and helps them along the way. This can add a fun dimension to the game.

Pets can be small and sensible (a cat, dog, or woodland creature) or large and absurd (a dinosaur, dragon, or elephant). A player’s pet can be used to get them out of a tough situation, as a weapon in battle, or just for added flavor and interest in role playing.

{{<callout title="Example">}}
Quill didn't expect the rope to snap on the sharp edge of the well, or he never would have come down here by himself.

Fortunately, he brought along Geoffrey, his pet rat. He instructed Geoffrey to scurry up the wall and find help.

_Roll to see what happens._
{{</callout>}}


### Tinkering

If you have an adventurer who loves to build things and has a big imagination, tinkering is an awesome special skill. A tinkerer can build small creations from bits of scrap metal and wood.

**Here’s how it works.**

- Tinkered items can be robotic toys, weapons, tools, and more.
- Tinkered items are small and fragile, and stop working after a few turns.
- Only one tinkered item can exist at a time.
- The parts from a tinkered item can be reclaimed to build another (either after it break, or when the adventurer decides they’d like to build something else).

The Game Master may choose to have the adventurer first acquire a tinker kit: gears, bits of scrap metal, and some small tools from a shopkeeper in the game.


### Chaos Magic

For added fun, you can introduce magical items that randomly unleash a surge of chaotic magic and create random effects.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Some things that can cause chaos magic:</strong></p>

- Wands, staffs, and magical talismans, when used to cast spells or conjure abilities
- Weapons and armor, when used in battle
- Potions and herbs of unknown origin, when consumed

You don't need to have random effects occur _every_ time the item is used. In fact, it's probably more fun if it happens occasionally. If you want, you can flip a coin.

**[Here's a list of random effects you can use.](/random-effects/)** Roll some dice to pick one at random.

{{<callout title="Introducing Chaos Magic Items">}}
Chaos magic items can be items that the players find in their travels, or they could be given to the players by the quest giver before they start their adventure.

> I borrowed some tools and supplies from Piper Skiprock, the wizard inventor, to aid you on your quest. He insisted that they're not finished yet, but they'll have be good enough for now. Time is of the essence...
