Every game of *Adventure* follows a three-part structure:

1. **A situation or problem** arises that needs the help of a group of adventurers.
2. The group **goes on a journey and has a series of encounters** as they try to resolve the situation or problem.
3. Once resolved, **a conclusion** ties off all the lose ends, and the adventurers are given a reward or find a prize for their efforts.

## Creating a Character

As an RPG (role-playing game), creating characters is a central part of the game. Each player should create a character to represent them as they go on their adventures.

They may want to draw a picture of their character, or use a toy or figurine to represent them in the game.

### Special Skills

Each character should pick just one special skill from each category.

| Combat       | Problem-Solving |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Attack<br><span class="text-muted text-small">(swordsmanship, bow-and-arrow skills, magic)</span> | Strength<br><span class="text-muted text-small">(lifting heavy things, physical intimidation)</span> |
| Defend<br><span class="text-muted text-small">(defensive arts, healing, potions)</span> | Speed/Dexterity<br><span class="text-muted text-small">(running, jumping, precision movement)</span> |
|              | Knowledge<br><span class="text-muted text-small">(plants and herbs, history, science)</span> |

While a character can dabble in all areas, they can only specialize in one.

### Character ideas

A player can be anything they want, but here are some ideas to help you out.

- A wizard, warlock, witch, or sorcerer
- An elf, druid, or healer
- A viking, knight, or warrior
- A hunter or marksman
- A thief or pirate
- A shapeshifter or animagus (person who can transform into an animal)

While they can pick a new character each time, it's more fun to keep the same character each time you play.

Their history and previous adventures carry with them each time you play.

### Pets

For added fun, each character can have a pet that accompanies them on their adventures and helps them along the way. This isn't required, but can add a fun dimension to the game.

Pets can be small and sensible (a cat or dog, woodland creatures) or large and absurd (a dinosaur, dragon hatchling, or elephant).



## Picking a Guide

Each game needs a *Guide* to run the game.

This person is generally not a player themselves. They introduce the situation or problem, guide players through the various encounters, and introduce challenges and side-adventures in response to player actions.

As the *Guide*, its your job to keep the pacing, action, and suspense at the right level for the skills and age-level of your players.



## Introducing the World

The first time you play, the *Guide* should introduce the world to the&nbsp;players.

You can create any type of fantasy world you want, but here's a little intro you can use if you need help getting started.

> You live in the land of Farfaria, in a tiny little village nestled between a mountain range and a sweeping forest.
>
> Rivers flow down from the mountains, cut through your village, and run through the forest, where they eventually connect with the ocean.
>
> While Farfaria is a small and remote town, you're hardly alone. The woods and mountains are filled with amazing, magical creatures: elves, fairies, centaurs, and wizards. They're filled with dangerous creatures&mdash;thieves, cults, and ogres&mdash;too. The ocean is filled with mermaids, krakens, and other monsters of the deep.
>
> Mysterious and exciting adventures always seem to find their way to your little village, where you and your brave group adventures are ready to help...



## Introducing the Situation

At the start of each game, a situation or problem arises that needs the help of a group of adventurers.

The *Guide* reads the game introduction to the players. Feel free to use toys, props, sketches and drawings, and fun voices to add to the excitement and mystery.

Here's an example:

> Lacey the Luck Dragon protects the forest from invaders. While out looking for food, her five baby dragons wandered off, and she can’t find them. She’s worried sick, and wants your help in locating them.
>
> Can you help her?

Once your adventurer's answer "yes," you can provide more details.

> Lacey the Dragon explains that her babies have just learned to fly, and aren’t very good at it.
>
> For protection, baby luck dragons can turn themselves invisible, making them hard to find. Baby dragons screech, scratch stuff with their claws, accidentally burn things, and, because they're covered in fur, smell like wet dog.
>
> Lacey gives you a satchel of gold coins to help you on your journey.

Each adventure starts off with a decision: how to find what they're looking for, where to look, which path to take, or what to do first.

In this example, you might ask...

> Where should you look first?

or...

> How can you find out where the first baby dragon is hiding?



## Actions and Deciding Outcomes

The outcome of every action that the players take is decided with a roll of the dice.

Each challenge or decision has a difficulty level. The player taking an action rolls a few dice. The highest number rolled determines the outcome.

### If the highest number is...

- Greater than or equal to the difficulty level, they succeed!
- Less than the difficulty level, they fail.
- Two or more lower than the difficulty, they fail, and something bad happens.

### Determining the number of dice to roll

- Every action starts with one base die.
- If the player's action relates to a skill they have, they get one bonus die.
- If they're using a tool or item, they also get a bonus die.

A player can never roll more than three dice.

### An example die roll

Let's revisit our example with Lacey the Luck Dragon.

The group needs to figure out where to go looking for the first baby dragon. **This has a difficulty level of 4.**

The players decide to try tracking the baby dragons in the forest by looking for burn marks and scratches on the tree, and listening for screeches. One of the players' problem solving skill is *Knowledge*, and they're a woodland Druid.

**That player gets to roll 2 dice:** one base die + a special skill bonus die.

- If they roll 4, 5, or 6, it works, and they successfully track the first baby dragon.
- If they roll a 3, the trail comes up dry and they have to try something else.
- If they roll a 1 or 2, it doesn't work *and* they're attacked by thieves who steal their gold.



## Encounters

Every game or adventure is made up of a series of encounters.

In our Lacey the Luck Dragon adventure, the encounters may include:

- Rescuing a baby dragon from a cave with a sleeping ogre
- Rescuing a baby dragon trapped in some tree vines
- Rescuing a baby dragon trapped in a spider’s underground den
- Rescuing a baby dragon from the edge of a mountain side cliff
- Rescuing a baby dragon trapped in a cage in the back room of a supply shop

Each encounter has a difficulty level, but usually does not have a single prescribed solution.

### Open-Ended Problem Solving

Players are encouraged to come up with creative solutions and ideas based on the tools you have available and the objects in their environment. Team work is also encouraged.

The *Guide* decides is the proposed actions are logical and work within the context of the encounter, and then decide how many dice the player taking the action can roll.

### Choose Your Own Adventure

Games are a bit like a choose your own adventure book.

Encounters do *not* have to happen sequentially. The order may vary based on decisions the players make and the actions they take.

### Bonus Encounters

Depending on the age of your players and how complex you'd like the game to be, you can mix bonus encounters into the main adventure.

For example, on the way from one location to the next, a group of thieves may attempt to buy or steal one of the baby dragons. You might introduce the encounter like this:

> As you make you way through the forest, you hear rustling in the trees to your left. A group of thieves emerge from the shadows.
>
> In the back stands a short woman with dark hair covered in a hood. She has a dagger on her side. In her left hand, she clutches a magic amulet. She's clearly the leader of the group. After a moment of silence, she says, "We've heard that you've located a baby dragon. We'd like to make you an offer."
>
> What do you do?

The group might choose to turn and run, take her up on the offer, or try to fight their way out of it (more on that shortly).

No matter what they choose, they roll dice to determine whether or not they're successful. What happens as a result may impact the rest of the game.

For example, if they agree to sell the baby dragon, or if they try to run but fail and the baby is stolen, they'll return back to Lacey with only four dragons. They might need to try to get the dragon back, or decide that that the amulet is worth more than whatever Lacey was offering.

It adds another rich dimension to the game.



## Battles

While much of *Adventure* is focused on exploring and problem solving, you can introduce battles as well to keep things interesting.

### How battles work

When a battle starts, the players and the *Guide* both roll a die.

If the players have the higher number, they go first. If the *Guide* has the higher number, the villains go first.

Each character/villain takes turns making an attack on a member of the opposing side, with the *Guide* controlling the villains. Players can be creative with how they attack, using their skills, tools, and items in the environment.

### Determining attack actions

Like all other actions in *Adventure*, attacks are determined by rolling dice.

Each villain in a battle has two characteristics: a difficulty level, and a health total (from 1-3). All players have a health total of 3.

**When a player attacks a villain**, they roll dice.

They get one base die. The get a bonus die if they have *Attack* as their combat style. They also get a bonus die if they have a special weapon or item they're using with their attack.

Like with other actions, use the highest number.

- If their die roll is equal to or higher than the villain's difficulty level, the villain loses a health point.
- If their die roll is lower than the villain's difficulty level, their attack misses.
- If their die roll is two or more lower than the villain's difficulty level, the villain hits them in response to the attack and *the player* loses a health point.

**When a villain attacks a player**, the *Guide* and the player both roll dice.

The player rolls one base die. They get a bonus die if they chose *Defend* as their combat style. They also get a bonus die if they have an item they want to use to protect themself.

The *Guide* rolls a number of dice equal to the villains base health level (before accounting for damage).

If the villain's highest roll is higher than the player's, the player loses a health point.

### Determining who wins a battle

When the villain have no health points left, they're knocked out of the game.

(*Frame this in whatever way is age-appropriate for your players.*)

If a player loses all of their health points, they're knocked out until one of the other players can help them. If a player helps a teammate who has been knocked out, or does something to heal their own damage, they forfeit their attack for that turn.

The battle is over when all of the villains have been defeated or the players retreat.

If all of the players are knocked out, the *Guide* can come up with a creative way to save them, or can have them suffer a setback as a result.



## Gear and Items

Gear and special items can be used to solve problems, overcome challenges, and give players new skills and abilities.

- **Gear** is an object that improves the player's ability in some way. For warriors, knights, and vikings, it might be a sword, an axe, a bow-and-arrow, or a shield. For witches, wizards, and druids, it might be a wand or a staff.
- **Items** are single-use objects that provide a one-time advantage to a player. This includes things like rope and nets, charms, spells, and potions. It might also include special arrows or weapons.

When used with an action, gear and items give the player using them a bonus die for their die roll (up to a maximum of 3 dice). Only one piece of gear and one item can be used per action.

### Starting gear and items

Each character should start the game with one piece of gear. This usually relates to the nature of their character.

For example, a druid may start with a staff. A pirate may start with a sword. A warrior with a *Defend* combat style may start with a shield for added protection, or pick up a sword to give them an extra die when attacking.

You may choose to have each player also start the game with a single-use item: rope, healing potion, food, or something else that will be useful in the adventure ahead.

### Earned and discovered items

As the players go on various adventures and encounters, they'll pick up more items&mdash;either as gifts from the people they help, or by discovering them in their travels.

Items can be shared with members in the group, and carry over from one game to the&nbsp;next.

### Item ideas

Here are some ideas for single-use items for use in your adventures.

- Invisibility Potion
- Quickness Potion
- Healing Potion
- Magic Feather (gives the power of flight)
- Magic Map (shows the location of what you want, then disintegrates)
- Climbing tools
- A Shovel
- A Protection Charm
- A walking stick/staff
- A wand (makes spells more potent, works for 3 spells)
- Breathewort (plant that lets you breathe underwater for 5 minutes)
- Magically inflating balloons
- X-ray spell
- Rope ladder
- Grappling hook
- Food
- Magical flute to call on a creature friend you’ve made in the past
- A stopwatch that rewinds time
- Torch/Magic Lantern
- Magic gloves (protect you from everything you touch)
- An empty box/pouch that can fit objects of any size
- Water spell (sends surge of water)
- Earth spell (move the earth)
- Lava spell (create a path of lava)
- Wind spell (create a powerful breeze)
- Ice spell (send an ice blast)
- Dragon scales (fireproof)
- A Compass



## Creating worlds

You can play *Adventure* entirely as a word-based RPG, and let your players use their imaginations.

However, depending on the age and interests of your players, it might be more fun and interesting if you added a physical element to the game. You can create sets for each of your encounters by sketching simple maps in a notebook, building them with Lego blocks, or using toys that you already have.

It can be a lot of fun to use action figures or paper cutouts for each of the characters, and let them move through physical environments as you play.



## Duration and Complexity

Games of *Adventure* can take as little as 30 minutes, or can last several hours.

As the *Guide*, you have a lot of control over the length and complexity of each game. You can add more villains and bonus encounters, adjust difficulty levels for encounters up or down, and save the day with third-party characters you introduce to the game.

You can also spread an adventure over several games, stopping after an encounter, and picking things back up another time.



## Advanced Die Rolls

*Adventure* is more fun when players work together to solve problems.

### Teamwork

If an encounter requires the skills of two or more people working together, calculate the total number of dice rolled based on each participating player's skills and items. Then, subtract one die for each person.

You can let a single person roll, or divide the dice among multiple players and have them all roll at once.

### Higher difficulty encounters

If players are easily completing challenges, or you have a lot of players, you may want to increase the difficulty of encounters beyond 6.

If you do, add their highest and lower numbers together instead of using just the highest number.



## Ending the Game

Once all of the main encounters have been completed, you can bring the adventure to a close.

For example, with the Lacey the Luck Dragon adventure, you might end the game by saying:

> You arrive at the entrance to Lacey the Luck Dragon’s cave with all 5 of her baby dragons.
>
> She emerges from the shadows, lowers her head to the ground, and looks each of you in the eye. “Thank you, truly, for returning my babies. I cannot thank you enough for what you have done.”
>
> As a token of her appreciation, she gives you a pair of magic gloves that protect you from anything you touch.

And with that, your game of *Adventure* draws to a close.
