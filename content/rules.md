In Adventure, players work together to overcome challenges, battle ferocious monsters, explore new worlds, discover hidden treasures, and, hopefully, save the day.

## How It Works

The game follows a simple pattern.

1. The _Game Master_ (or _GM_, the person running the game) describes a situation.
2. The player or players state what they want to do.
3. The GM describes what happens.

The most important phrase in Adventure is, "What do you do?"

{{<callout title="Example">}}
**GM:** "Before you lies a bridge. There are boards missing in places, and the ones that remain appear old and rotted. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to walk across, carefully checking for loose boards as I go."

**GM:** "As you're walking across, one of the boards starts to break under your feet. As you scramble across, the entire bridge begins to collapse. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to jump to the other side before the whole bridge falls down."

**GM:** "You push off the breaking board with all of your might, catching the ledge with your fingers and hoisting yourself over the edge. The bridge falls into the chasm below you. But as you do, your sword falls out of your hilt and drops onto a ledge about 20 feet down. What do you do?"
{{</callout>}}



## What You Need to Play

1. **Dice.** Adventure uses a single six-sided die (_or a D20 if you'd prefer_). If you don't have any dice, you can [roll digital dice](/dice/).
2. **A notebook.** A place to write down details about the characters and the story. If you prefer, you can print our character sheets from [the downloads page](/downloads).
3. **Your imagination.** The most important part!



## Creating a Character

Each player creates a character to represent them on their adventures (this is what makes Adventure an RPG, or _role-playing game_).

- **Name & Description.** You can be anyone you want to be in adventure: an elf wizard, a fairy tinkerer, a space cowboy, a dragonfly spy. Be anything you want.
- **Skills.** What makes your character unique? Do they have a special skill, like fire breathing or the ability to fly? Are they a really good swimmer? Can they make themselves invisible or fly? Do they know any magic spells?
- **Stuff.** Start the game with a weapon or wand, rope, water, food, a few coins, and one healing potion. Add stuff as you find it in your travels.

The [downloads section](/downloads) includes premade characters if you need examples or want to start playing immediately.

<!-- @TODO: move to GM page. _Players may want to use a toy, figurine, or paper cut-out to represent their character while they play._ -->



## Actions & Deciding Outcomes

Any time you want to add chance to the outcome of a player action, the GM should ask them to roll a die (either a D6 or D20, your choice).

| D6  | Outcome                                  | D20   |
|-----|------------------------------------------|-------|
| 6   | Success. It worked as planned.           | 17+   |
| 3-5 | Partial Success. It worked, with a cost. | 9-16  |
| 2-  | Failure. It didn't work.                 | 8-    |

{{<callout title="Example">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>The player is trying to convince a wealthy noble that they're a distant relative.</strong> The noble isn't very trusting. They roll a D6.</p>

- On 6, the noble believes them, offering them a room in their palace and a feast in their honor.
- On a 3 to 5, the noble reluctantly believes them, but secretly sends someone to look into their background.
- On an 2 or less, the noble becomes angry, and has them arrested.
{{</callout>}}

### Rolls are optional

Reserve die rolls for instances where the outcome is uncertain, or where both failure and success would be interesting to the story.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Rolls are good for things like...</strong></p>

- Difficult tasks like climbing steep walls or picking locks.
- Casting complex or powerful spells.
- Attacking monsters or defending yourself against attacks.
- Trying to learn information about an unknown person, place, or object.

If the thing the player is trying to do is really easy or impossibly difficult, skip the die roll and let it succeed or fail automatically.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
- **The players find a mysterious, glowing rock deep in a cavern.** They ask, "What is this? What does it do?" The GM asks them to roll a die.
- **The player attempts to hit an ogre with their sword.** The GM asks them to roll a die.
- **The player tries to to jump over a fallen goblin.** They automatically succeed.
- **The player punches a thick stone wall, attempting to break it down.** They automatically fail.
{{</callout>}}

### Best Roll & Worst Roll

Items, special skills, and circumstances may give the player an advantage or disadvantage in attempting to complete a task.

- **Best Roll.** Roll two dice and take the higher number.
- **Worst Roll.** Roll two dice and take the lower number.

Players use _Best Roll_ when they have an advantage, and _Worst Roll_ when they have a disadvantage.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Best Roll
: The player is attempting to sneak up on a camp and surprise them. It's nighttime, and their character is stealthy. They have an advantage, and take the best roll of two dice.

Worst Roll
: An evil wizard uses a spell to shroud the cavern in darkness, and the player cannot see them. They attempt to shoot an arrow at wizard through the darkness. They're at a disadvantage, and take the worse roll of two dice.
{{</callout>}}

Fleeing a Battle

Every now and then, players may find themselves in a battle they just can't win.

Players can choose to flee a battle at any time, including in the middle of one. The Game Master may require a die roll to determine what happens. -->

### Teamwork

Adventure is a cooperative, team game. The more you work together, the more likely you are to succeed.

- **For group tasks**, like trying to cross a river or sneak into a castle, if at least half of the party succeeds, everyone does.
- **For individual tasks**, if you can reasonably assist a teammate, they get _Best Roll_.

{{<callout title="Example">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small">A three-person party is trying to sneak into the castle undetected. The Game Master asks for a roll. Because this involves stealth, players who specialize in Speed take Best Roll.</p>

- If all three players make their roll, the party succeeds.
- If one player fails and two succeed, the party still succeeds.
- If two players fail, but one succeeds, they all fail.
{{</callout>}}



## Health, Damage & Healing

As an adventurer, you’re going to get hurt from time-to-time. Cuts, bruises, and serious injury are a common risk.

- **Health Points** (or _HP_) represent a character's overall health. Each player starts the game with 3 HP, and cannot ever have more than that.
- **Damage.** Any time a character is hit by a monster or seriously injured (from a fall, for example), subtract 1 HP from their total.
- **Knocked Out.** When a player's HP reaches 0, they're knocked out and cannot do anything until they have at least 1 HP.
- **Healing.** Players can recover 1 HP after a short rest, first aid, or healing spell. They can regain 3 HP with a healing potion.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
- **A knight hits a hydra with her sword.** The hydra loses 1 HP.
- **A wizard slips while scaling a cliff face and falls 20 feet.** The wizard loses 1 HP, their last, and gets knocked out.
- **A druid casts a healing spell on their unconscious teammate.** The teammate returns to 1 HP and wakes up.
{{</callout>}}



## Character Progression

As your character goes on adventures, they’ll gain new experiences, pick up new skills, and find cool stuff.

If you want, you can use the same character from one adventurer to the next, and bring their skills, gear, and treasure along with them.

## House Rules

House rules are strongly encouraged in Adventure. Here are some ideas you may want to adapt to your game.

### Pets

For added fun, characters can have a pet that accompanies them on their adventures and helps them along the way. This can add a fun dimension to the game.

Pets can be small and sensible (a cat, dog, or woodland creature) or large and absurd (a dinosaur, dragon, or elephant). A player’s pet can be used to get them out of a tough situation, as a weapon in battle, or just for added flavor and interest in role playing.

{{<callout title="Example">}}
Quill didn't expect the rope to snap on the sharp edge of the well, or he never would have come down here by himself.

Fortunately, he brought along Geoffrey, his pet rat. He instructed Geoffrey to scurry up the wall and find help.

_Roll to see what happens._
{{</callout>}}


### Tinkering

If you have an adventurer who loves to build things and has a big imagination, tinkering is an awesome special skill. A tinkerer can build small creations from bits of scrap metal and wood.

**Here’s how it works.**

- Tinkered items can be robotic toys, weapons, tools, and more.
- Tinkered items are small and fragile, and stop working after a few turns.
- Only one tinkered item can exist at a time.
- The parts from a tinkered item can be reclaimed to build another (either after it break, or when the adventurer decides they’d like to build something else).

The Game Master may choose to have the adventurer first acquire a tinker kit: gears, bits of scrap metal, and some small tools from a shopkeeper in the game.


### Chaos Magic

For added fun, you can introduce magical items that randomly unleash a surge of chaotic magic and create random effects.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Some things that can cause chaos magic:</strong></p>

- Wands, staffs, and magical talismans, when used to cast spells or conjure abilities
- Weapons and armor, when used in battle
- Potions and herbs of unknown origin, when consumed

You don't need to have random effects occur _every_ time the item is used. In fact, it's probably more fun if it happens occasionally. If you want, you can flip a coin.

**[Here's a list of random effects you can use.](/random-effects/)** Roll some dice to pick one at random.

{{<callout title="Introducing Chaos Magic Items">}}
Chaos magic items can be items that the players find in their travels, or they could be given to the players by the quest giver before they start their adventure.

> I borrowed some tools and supplies from Piper Skiprock, the wizard inventor, to aid you on your quest. He insisted that they're not finished yet, but they'll have be good enough for now. Time is of the essence...
