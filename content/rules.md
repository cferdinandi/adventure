In Adventure, players work together to overcome challenges, battle ferocious monsters, explore new worlds, discover hidden treasures, and, hopefully, save the day.

<div data-toc="Table of Content"></div>



## How It Works

The game follows a simple pattern.

1. The _Game Master_ (or _GM_, the person running the game) describes a situation.
2. The player or players state what they want to do.
3. The GM describes what happens.

The most important phrase in Adventure is, "What do you do?"

{{<callout title="Example">}}
**GM:** "Before you lies a bridge. There are boards missing in places, and the ones that remain appear old and rotted. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to walk across, carefully checking for loose boards as I go."

**GM:** "As you're walking across, one of the boards starts to break under your feet. As you scramble across, the entire bridge begins to collapse. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to jump to the other side before the whole bridge falls down."

**GM:** "You push off the breaking board with all of your might, catching the ledge with your fingers and hoisting yourself over the edge. The bridge falls into the chasm below you. But as you do, your sword falls out of its hilt and drops onto a ledge about 20 feet down. What do you do?"
{{</callout>}}



## What You Need to Play

1. **Dice.** Adventure uses two six-sided dice (_sometimes called 2D6_). If you don't have any dice, you can [roll digital dice](/dice/).
2. **A notebook.** A place to write down details about the characters and the story. If you prefer, you can print out character sheets from [the downloads page](/downloads).
3. **Your imagination.** The most important part!



## Creating a Character

Each player creates a character to represent them on their adventures (this is what makes Adventure an RPG, or _role-playing game_).

<div class="list-spaced-small">
{{%md%}}
- **Name & Description.** You can be anyone you want to be in adventure: an elf wizard, a fairy alchemist, a birdfolk spy. Be anything you want.
- **Skills & Abilities.** What makes your character unique? Can they breath fire or fly? Are they experts at elemental magic or illusions? Are they a skilled archer?
- **Stuff.** Each character starts the game with rope, water, food, ten coins, one healing potion, and a personal item with a story behind it. You'll find more in your travels.
{{%/md%}}
</div>

The [downloads section](/downloads) includes premade characters if you need examples or want to start playing immediately.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Fin
: An elf who specializes in nature magic and can talk to animals. His staff is made form a birch tree and changes with the seasons (_ex. flowers in the spring_).

Flower
: A fairy knight who can fly and wields a battleaxe made from an enchanted sunflower. She protects her village from the forces of evil.

Spark
: A dragon chemist, Spark creates potions that give magical properties to whoever drinks them. They want to open a medicinal tea shop.
{{</callout>}}



## Actions & Outcomes

Actions and outcomes should follow the logic and fiction of the story you're telling.

Any time you want to add chance to the outcome of a player action, the GM can ask them to roll two six-sided dice (2D6) and add the resulting numbers together.

| Roll | Outcome                                  |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 9+   | Success. It worked as planned.           |
| 6-8  | Partial Success. It worked, with a cost. |
| 5-   | Failure. It didn't work.                 |

{{<callout title="Examples">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>The player is trying to convince a wealthy noble that they're a distant relative.</strong> The noble is skeptical. They roll 2D6.</p>

- On 9 or higher, the noble is convinced, offering them a room in their palace and a feast in their honor.
- On a 6 to 8, the noble reluctantly believes them, but secretly sends someone to look into their background.
- On an 5 or less, the noble knows they're lying, and has them arrested.
{{</callout>}}

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Items, special skills, and circumstances may give the player an _advantage_ or _disadvantage_ in attempting to complete a task.

- **Advantage.** Roll three six-sided dice (3D6) and take the best two dice.
- **Disadvantage.** Roll three six-sided dice (3D6) and take the worst two dice.

This is an easy way to give players bonuses based on their skills and stuff.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Advantage
: The player is attempting to sneak up on a camp and surprise them. It's nighttime, making them harder to see. They roll 3D6 and take the best two dice.

Disadvantage
: An evil wizard uses a spell to shroud the cavern in darkness, and the player cannot see them. They attempt to shoot an arrow at wizard through the darkness at a target they can't see. They roll roll 3D6 and take the worst two dice.
{{</callout>}}

### Teamwork

Adventure is a cooperative, team game. The more you work together, the more likely you are to succeed.

- **For group tasks**, like trying to cross a river or sneak into a castle, if at least half of the party succeeds, everyone does.
- **For individual tasks**, if a player can reasonably assist a teammate, the teammate _rolls with advantage_.

{{<callout title="Example">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small">A three-person party is trying to sneak into the castle undetected. The Game Master asks for a roll.</p>

- If all three players make their roll, the party succeeds.
- If one player fails and two succeed, the party still succeeds.
- If two players fail, but one succeeds, they all fail.
{{</callout>}}

### Rolls are optional

Reserve dice rolls for instances where the outcome is uncertain, or where both failure and success would be interesting to the story.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Rolls are good for things like...</strong></p>

- Difficult tasks like climbing steep walls or picking locks.
- Casting complex or powerful spells.
- Attacking monsters or defending yourself against attacks.
- Trying to learn information about an unknown person, place, or object.

If the thing the player is trying to do is really easy or impossibly difficult, skip the die roll and let it succeed or fail automatically.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
- **The players find a mysterious, glowing rock deep in a cavern.** They ask, "What is this? What does it do?" The GM asks them to roll a die.
- **The player attempts to hit an ogre with their sword.** The GM asks them to roll a die.
- **The player tries to to jump over a fallen goblin.** They automatically succeed.
- **The player punches a thick stone wall, attempting to break it down.** They automatically fail.
{{</callout>}}

### Combat

Combat works the same as any other action in Adventure.

If the player would be able to attack without any chance of being blocked (for example, when they have the element of surprise), the hit lands automatically. Otherwise, roll to see what happens.

- **9+:** The hit lands
- **6-8:** The hit lands, but the player gets hit too or put in a tough spot

{{<callout title="Example">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small">The knight swings his sword at an ogre...</p>

- **He snuck up behind the ogre.** The ogre didn't see it coming, and the hit automatically lands.
- **9+.** The ogre tries to duck, but isn't fast enough. The hit lands.
- **6-8.** The hit lands, but the sword gets stuck in the ogre's tough hide and is ripped out of the knight's hands.
{{</callout>}}

### Magic & Spellcasting

Simple spells can be cast at will. Complex and powerful spells require a roll of the dice, and may have unintended side-effects or draw unwanted attention if they fail.

The spells you cast should work thematically with the character. Describe what you want to to do, and the GM will tell if you if its possible and how it might work. 

You can acquire additional spells and abilities through training. You'll also find spell books, scrolls, and magic items on your travels.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Fin specializes in nature magic.

- **He wants to light a small fire by snapping his fingers.** This is a simple spell that can be cast at will and always works.
- **He wants to make vines grow out of the earth and tangle an enemy.** This is a complex spell. He rolls 2D6.
	+ **9+:** It works as expected.
	+ **6-8:** It works, but also tangles one of the other players.
	+ **5-:** Fin's connection to the earth breaks, and the spell fails.
- **He tries to teleport.** This isn't nature magic, so nothing happens.
- **He acquires a ring of teleportation, and wants to use it.** He rolls 2D6 to see what happens.
{{</callout>}}

### Crafting, Tinkering & Repairs

In Adventure, you can attempt to craft items, build mechanical inventions, and repair damaged equipment.

Simple items may only need a bit of time and a safe place to work. More complex items may require you to find ingredients or materials, and might also require a dice roll to see if it works or not.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Spark the dragon crafts magical potions brewed into tea.

- **They want to craft a simple healing potion.** This is their signature tea, and works as long as Spark can find an hour of time to combine the ingredients and brew the tea.
- **They've been in a dungeon for a few days, and want to brew a healing potion.** Spark is low on the required ingredients, and will need to acquire some first. They roll 2D6 to see if they can scavenge some of the required mushrooms for a nearby tunnel.
- **They're trying to craft a new potion that lets the drink breath underwater.** Spark rolls 2D6 to scavenge the required ingredients, and another 2D6 to see if their potion works as expected.
{{</callout>}}




## Health & Healing

As an adventurer, you’re going to get hurt from time-to-time. Cuts, bruises, and serious injury are a common risk.

- **Moderate Injury.** Things like puncture wounds, deep cuts, and broken bones.
- **Serious Injury.** Things like head and torso injuries, lost limbs, and high falls.
- **Fatal Injuries.** Anything that would reasonably end a character's life.
  
Injuries beyond minor cuts and scrapes impart conditions that have in-game and mechanical impacts on a character.

If left untreated, four moderate injuries, two serious injuries, or one fatal injury also cause a character to [take their last breath](#last-breath).

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
- **An arrow pierces Fin's leg (_moderate_).** He walks with limp, and has disadvantage on all rolls that require use of the leg.
- **Flower is hit in the head with a warhammer (_serious_).** She's stunned and confused, and has disadvantage on all rolls that involve thinking.
- **Spark falls off a 50' drop (_serious/fatal_).** They're immediately knocked unconscious, and fail all actions until revived.
{{</callout>}}

### Healing

Players can recover from injuries in a few of ways.

<div class="list-columns margin-bottom">
{{%md%}}
- Healing potion
- Time and rest
- First aid
- A skilled healer
- Magic items
{{%/md%}}
</div>

How much they heal is dependent on the severity of the injury, the method used, and the abilities of the person doing the healing. Conditions caused by the injury may remain even after it's healed.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
- **Fin has an arrow lodged in his right leg.** He rips it out and chugs a healing potion. The puncture heals over, and he no longer has disadvantage on rolls for actions using his leg.
- **Flower is stunned from being hit in the head with a warhammer.** She visits a healer who gives her a healing elixir. After a days rest, she's able to think clearly again.
- **Spark has a deep gash on their arm.** Out of healing potions, they bandage it up with some herbs. After three days, the wound heals, and disadvantage no longer applies.
{{</callout>}}

### Last Breath

A character takes their **last breath** after four moderate injuries, two serious injuries, or one fatal injury.

<p class="margin-bottom-small">If not healed or revived within a short period of time, roll to see what happens.</p>

- **9+:** Death allows them to return to the living. 
- **6-8:** Death requires something in return.
  
For a less dark and gritty experience, characters with too many injuries can instead become **knocked out**. A knocked out character cannot do anything until revived with time and rest, magic, or a skilled healer.

_Whether from taking their last breath or being knocked out, a revived character may still have lingering in-game conditions and effects._



## Character Progression

As your character goes on adventures, they’ll learn new skills and find cool stuff. You can use the same character from one adventurer to the next, and bring their skills, gear, and treasure along with them.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>As you go on adventures, you  might...</strong></p>

- Learn a new skill or ability.
- Replace an existing skill or ability with a new one.
- Increase the power of a skill or ability.
- Acquire weapons and magic items that give you new abilities.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
- In his travels, Fin finds a crystal that intensifies the power of his nature magic. He's now able to move large chunks of earth.
- Flower acquires a lucky rabbits foot that seems to grant her a magical sense about where her enemies will next strike. She can use it to turn a failed combat roll into a success once per day.
- Spark discovers a recipe for a long forgotten magical potion that causes whoever consumes it to double in strength for an hour.

## A Sample Game

To help this all stick, let's look at a sample game with  knight and a wizard.

{{<callout>}}
**GM:** As you enter the cave, you see a sleeping ogre curled up around a massive pile of gold. One arm rests over the pile, while his other hand gently clutches a massive wooden club. In the back of the cave, you see the baby dragon you've been sent to rescue wrapped up in an old blanket. What do you do?

**Knight:** I try to quietly sneak past the ogre.

**Wizard:** While he does that, I'm going to attempt to carefully steal a few coins from the ogre's treasure while he sleeps.

**GM:** Ok. Both of you make a roll. Knight, roll with disadvantage because your metal armor is very creaky and clunky.

**Wizard:** I rolled a 2 and a 5... 7 total.

**Knight:** I rolled a 4, 3, and 1, so... 4 with disadvantage.

(_The Wizard partially succeeds. The Knight fails._)

**GM:** Great, thanks. The Wizard carefully picks up three gold coins and tucks them into her pocket. As she reaches for a fourth, the Knight's elbow accidentally bumps into the cave wall. The metal of his armor "clangs" and reverberates through the cave, growing louder before tapering off.

The ogre's eyes flutter open. He catches sight of the Wizard's outstretched arm reaching for his horde. He shouts:

> Just what do you think you're doing!?

He stands up, towering a good six feet over Wizard's head. What do you do?

**Wizard:** Umm... uh... I tell him that the coins looked dirty and I was just going to clean them for him!

**GM:** Ok, make a roll.

**Wizard:** I rolled a total of 4.

(_That's a failure._)

**GM:** The ogre rubs the crust from his eyes, lifts the club over his head, and says:

> Do you think I was born yesterday?

Then, he lets out a roar and swings the club down towards you. What do you do?

**Knight:** Seeing the ogre about to crush my friend, I unhilt my sword and swing it up to meet the club before it hits her.

**GM:** Excellent, make a roll.

**Knight:** I rolled 10.

(_That's a success._)

**GM:** As the club rushes down toward the Wizard's head, she closes her eyes and instinctively ducks. Knight rushes between her and the ogre, unhilting his sword and swinging it up towards the club in one fluid movement.

His sword meets the club inches before it hits the Wizard. The ogre, caught off guard, stumbles backwards a few feet. What do you do?
{{</callout>}}

As you can see, the game is a series of choices, actions, die rolls, consequences, and next steps. Every choice the players make, and every random outcome of the dice, leads to the next logical step in the story.
