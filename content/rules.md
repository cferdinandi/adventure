In Adventure, players work together to overcome challenges, battle ferocious monsters, explore new worlds, discover hidden treasures, and, hopefully, save the day.

<div data-toc="Table of Content"></div>



## How It Works

The game follows a simple pattern.

1. The _Game Master_ (or _GM_, the person running the game) describes a situation.
2. The player or players state what they want to do.
3. The GM describes what happens.

The most important phrase in Adventure is, "What do you do?"

{{<callout title="Example">}}
**GM:** "Before you lies a bridge. There are boards missing in places, and the ones that remain appear old and rotted. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to walk across, carefully checking for loose boards as I go."

**GM:** "As you're walking across, one of the boards starts to break under your feet. As you scramble across, the entire bridge begins to collapse. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to jump to the other side before the whole bridge falls down."

**GM:** "You push off the breaking board with all of your might, catching the ledge with your fingers and hoisting yourself over the edge. The bridge falls into the chasm below you. But as you do, your sword falls out of your hilt and drops onto a ledge about 20 feet down. What do you do?"

## What You Need to Play

1. **Dice.** Adventure uses two six-sided dice (_sometimes called 2D6_). If you don't have any dice, you can [roll digital dice](/dice/).
2. **A notebook.** A place to write down details about the characters and the story. If you prefer, you can print out character sheets from [the downloads page](/downloads).
3. **Your imagination.** The most important part!



## Creating a Character

Each player creates a character to represent them on their adventures (this is what makes Adventure an RPG, or _role-playing game_).

<div class="list-spaced-small">
{{%md%}}
- **Name & Appearance.** You can be anyone you want to be in adventure: an elf with flowers for hair, a fairy pirate, a robot knight, a dragonfly in a straw hat.
- **Gift or Talent.** What makes your character unique? Can they breath fire or fly? Are they experts at elemental magic or illusions? Are they a skilled archer?
- **Goal or Passion.** What does your character want most in life? Do they strive to vanquish evil? Open an animal sanctuary? Explore a distant land?
- **Item with a Story.** What's your character's most prized possession, and why? How long have they had it? Where did they get it? What's the story behind it?
- **Stuff.** Each character starts the game with a weapon or wand, rope, water, food, a few coins, and one healing potion. You'll find more in your travels.

The [downloads section](/downloads) includes premade characters if you need examples or want to start playing immediately.

### Bonds & Connections

If you're going on an adventure with others, what's your connection with them? Ask the player to your left and right one question each.

- Why do you trust me?
- What secret of yours do I know?
- Who do I remind you of?
- How did I help you in a time of need?

Write down their answers, and use them to guide your interactions during the game.



## Actions & Deciding Outcomes

Any time you want to add chance to the outcome of a player action, the GM should ask them to roll two six-sided dice (2D6) and add the resulting numbers together.

| Roll | Outcome                                  |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 9+   | Success. It worked as planned.           |
| 6-8  | Partial Success. It worked, with a cost. |
| 5-   | Failure. It didn't work.                 |

{{<callout title="Examples">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>The player is trying to convince a wealthy noble that they're a distant relative.</strong> The noble isn't very trusting. They roll 2D6.</p>

- On 9 or higher, the noble believes them, offering them a room in their palace and a feast in their honor.
- On a 6 to 8, the noble reluctantly believes them, but secretly sends someone to look into their background.
- On an 5 or less, the noble becomes angry, and has them arrested.
{{</callout>}}

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Items, special skills, and circumstances may give the player an _advantage_ or _disadvantage_ in attempting to complete a task.

- **Advantage.** Roll three six-sided dice (3D6) and take the best two dice.
- **Disadvantage.** Roll three six-sided dice (3D6) and take the worst two dice.

This is an easy way to give players bonuses based on their skills and stuff.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
Advantage
: The player is attempting to sneak up on a camp and surprise them. It's nighttime, making them harder to see. They roll 3D6 and take the best two dice.

Disadvantage
: An evil wizard uses a spell to shroud the cavern in darkness, and the player cannot see them. They attempt to shoot an arrow at wizard through the darkness at a target they can't see. They roll roll 3D6 and take the worst two dice.
{{</callout>}}

### Teamwork

Adventure is a cooperative, team game. The more you work together, the more likely you are to succeed.

- **For group tasks**, like trying to cross a river or sneak into a castle, if at least half of the party succeeds, everyone does.
- **For individual tasks**, if a player can reasonably assist a teammate, the teammate _rolls with advantage_.

{{<callout title="Example">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small">A three-person party is trying to sneak into the castle undetected. The Game Master asks for a roll.</p>

- If all three players make their roll, the party succeeds.
- If one player fails and two succeed, the party still succeeds.
- If two players fail, but one succeeds, they all fail.
{{</callout>}}

### Rolls are optional

Reserve die rolls for instances where the outcome is uncertain, or where both failure and success would be interesting to the story.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Rolls are good for things like...</strong></p>

- Difficult tasks like climbing steep walls or picking locks.
- Casting complex or powerful spells.
- Attacking monsters or defending yourself against attacks.
- Trying to learn information about an unknown person, place, or object.

If the thing the player is trying to do is really easy or impossibly difficult, skip the die roll and let it succeed or fail automatically.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
- **The players find a mysterious, glowing rock deep in a cavern.** They ask, "What is this? What does it do?" The GM asks them to roll a die.
- **The player attempts to hit an ogre with their sword.** The GM asks them to roll a die.
- **The player tries to to jump over a fallen goblin.** They automatically succeed.
- **The player punches a thick stone wall, attempting to break it down.** They automatically fail.
{{</callout>}}

### Combat

Combat works the same as any other action in Adventure.

If the player would be able to attack without any chance of being blocked (for example, when they have the element of surprise), the hit lands automatically. Otherwise, roll to see what happens.

- **9+:** The hit lands
- **6-8:** The hit lands, but they get hit too or put in a tough spot

{{<callout title="Example">}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small">The knight swings his sword at an ogre...</p>

- **He snuck up behind the ogre.** The ogre didn't see it coming, and the hit automatically lands.
- **9+.** The ogre tries to duck, but isn't fast enough. The hit lands.
- **6-8.** The ogre swings out in response, pushing the knight back and causing him to drop his sword.
{{</callout>}}




## Health & Healing

As an adventurer, you’re going to get hurt from time-to-time. Cuts, bruises, and serious injury are a common risk.

- **Health Points** (_HP_) represent a character's overall health. Each player starts the game with 6 HP, and cannot ever have more than that.
- **Damage.** Any time a character is hit by a monster or seriously injured (from a fall, for example), subtract 1 HP (or more) from their total. Bigger monsters and threats may cause more damage.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
- **A knight hits a hydra with her sword.** The hydra loses 1 HP.
- **A wizard slips while scaling a cliff face and falls 20 feet.** They loses 1 HP.
- **A dragon breathes fire on the barbarian.** The barbarian loses 3 HP.
{{</callout>}}

### Environmental Damage

Adventuring is dangerous, and sometimes traps and the environment cause injuries.

- **Cuts & Scrapes:** 1 Damage
- **Broken Bones:** 3 Damage
- **Lethal:** 6 Damage

### Healing

Players can recover lost Health Points in a variety of ways.

- **Short Rest:** 1 HP
- **Long Rest:** 3 HP
- **First Aid:** 1 HP
- **Healing Spell:** 2 HP
- **Healing Potion:** 4 HP

### Knocked Out & Last Breath

When a player's HP reaches 0, you have two options, depending on how dark and gritty you want your game to be.

- **Knocked Out.** A knocked out character cannot do anything until they have at least 1 HP. A teammate can heal them, or they can rest for a short while.
- **Last Breath.** A dying character can be revived if healed by a teammate. If that doesn't happen in time, have them roll to see what happens. On a 9+, Death allows them to return to the living. On a 6-8, Death requires something in return.




## Character Progression @todo replace with Tokens

As a character goes on adventures, they’ll gain new experiences, pick up new skills, and find cool stuff.

<p class="margin-bottom-small">At the end of a session, if they battled a cool monster, found cool loot, or explored a new location, the GM can reward them with...</p>

- A new skill
- An enhancement to an exist ability
- A magic item

If you want, you can use the same character from one adventurer to the next, and bring their skills, gear, and treasure along with them.



## A Sample Game

To help this all stick, let's look at a sample game with two characters: a knight and a wizard.

{{<callout>}}
**GM:** As you enter the cave, you see a sleeping ogre curled up around a massive pile of gold. One arm rests over the pile, while his other hand gently clutches a massive wooden club. In the back of the cave, you see the baby dragon you've been sent to rescue wrapped up in an old blanket. What do you do?

**Knight:** I try to quietly sneak past the ogre.

**Wizard:** While he does that, I'm going to attempt to carefully steal a few coins from the ogre's treasure while he sleeps.

**GM:** Ok. Both of you make a roll. Knight, roll with disadvantage because your metal armor is very creaky and clunky.

**Wizard:** I rolled a 2 and a 5... 7 total.

**Knight:** I rolled a 4, 3, and 1, so... 4 with disadvantage.

(_The Wizard partially succeeds. The Knight fails._)

**GM:** Great, thanks. The Wizard carefully picks up three gold coins and tucks them into her pocket. As she reaches for a fourth, the Knight's elbow accidentally bumps into the cave wall. The metal of his armor "clangs" and reverberates through the cave, growing louder before tapering off.

The ogre's eyes flutter open. He catches sight of the Wizard's outstretched arm reaching for his horde. He shouts:

> Just what do you think you're doing!?

He stands up, towering a good six feet over Wizard's head. What do you do?

**Wizard:** Umm... uh... I tell him that the coins looked dirty and I was just going to clean them for him!

**GM:** Ok, make a roll.

**Wizard:** I rolled a total of 4.

(_That's a failure._)

**GM:** The ogre rubs the crust from his eyes, lifts the club over his head, and says:

> Do you think I was born yesterday?

Then, he lets out a roar and swings the club down towards you. What do you do?

**Knight:** Seeing the ogre about to crush my friend, I unhilt my sword and swing it up to meet the club before it hits her.

**GM:** Excellent, make a roll.

**Knight:** I rolled 10.

(_That's a success._)

**GM:** As the club rushes down toward the Wizard's head, she closes her eyes and instinctively ducks. Knight rushes between her and the ogre, unhilting his sword and swinging it up towards the club in one fluid movement.

His sword meets the club inches before it hits the Wizard. The ogre, caught off guard, stumbles backwards a few feet. What do you do?

As you can see, the game is a series of choices, actions, die rolls, consequences, and next steps. Every choice the players make, and every random outcome of the dice, leads to the next logical step in the story.
