In Adventure, players work together to overcome challenges, battle ferocious monsters, explore new worlds, discover hidden treasures, and, hopefully, save the day.

## How it works

The game follows a simple pattern.

1. The _Game Master_ (or _GM_, the person running the game) describes a situation.
2. The player or players state what they want to do.
3. The GM describes what happens.

The most important phrase in Adventure is, "What do you do?"

{{<callout title="Example">}}
**GM:** "You approach a bridge. There are boards missing in places, and the ones that remain appear old and rotted. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to walk across, carefully checking for loose boards as I go."

**GM:** "As you're walking across, one of the boards starts to break under your feet. As you scramble across, the entire bridge begins to collapse. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to jump to the other side before the whole bridge falls down."

**GM:** "You push off the breaking board with all of your might, catching the ledge with your fingers and hoisting yourself over the edge. The bridge falls into the chasm below you. But as you do, your sword falls out of your hilt and drops onto a ledge about 20 feet down. What do you do?"

## What you need to play

1. **A set of polyhedral dice.** Adventure uses the following dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, and D20. If you don't have any, [you can roll digital dice here](https://www.wizards.com/dnd/dice/dice.htm).
2. **Character sheets.** You can print them out from [the downloads page](/downloads).
3. **Your imagination.** The most important part!

You might want to keep a pen and notebook handy, but it's not at all required to play.

_Dice are described using D* naming, where * is the number of sides the die has. For example, a standard six-sided die is a D6. A die with eight sides is a D8._



## Creating a Character

Every player creates a character to play in the game.

The [downloads section](/downloads) includes printable character sheets to guide you through the process. You'll also reference them throughout the game.

### 1. Picking a class

A class is a bit like a job or way of life.

Each class comes with unique features and abilities. Classes are designed to be customized and tailored to fit whatever kind of character you want to be.

- **Fighter.** Skilled with armor and a wide range of weapons, fighters are athletic warriors. *ex. Barbarian, Soldier, Samurai, Knight, Superhero*
- **Wizard.** Masters of magic, wizards can do stuff like shoot fireballs from their hands, teleport, and create illusions. *ex. Wizard, Witch, Sorcerer, Warlock, Mystic, Enchanter*
- **Druid.** Sharing a deep connection with nature, druids can control the elements and even transform into animals. *ex. Druid, Ranger, Shapeshifter*
- **Rogue.** Quick on their feet and skilled at stealth, rogues move in the shadows and operate behind the scenes. *ex. Thief, Robin Hood, Ninja, Spy*
- **Bard.** Talented and outgoing, bards weave a touch of magic into every performance. *ex. Musician, Storyteller, Fire Breather, Diplomat*

### 2. Picking a name and ancestry

Your ancestry is your background and the type of creature you are.

You can be a human, of course. But you can also be any other sort of fantastical creature you'd like: an elf, gnome, fairy, dragon, and more. The only limit here is your imagination.

And your name is, well... your name!

### 3. Assigning your stats

Just like in real life, every character is good at some things and not-so-good at others.

Stats are broad categories that you assign a number value to. Positive numbers are things you're good at, and negative numbers are things you bad at. The higher the number, the better you are at that thing (and vice-versa).

Your stats affect how easy or hard certain tasks are for your in the game.

- **Strength (STR).** Athletics, Feats of Strength
- **Dexterity (DEX).** Acrobatics, Slight of Hand, Stealth
- **Constituation (CON).** Endurance, Stamina, Concentration
- **Intelligence (INT).** Knowing Things, Book Smarts
- **Wisdom (WIS).** Perceiving Things, Street Smarts
- **Charisma (CHA).** Deception, Persuasion, Performance

When you start the game, take the following numbers and assign each one to a stat: +2, +1, +1, 0, -1, -1.

{{<callout title="Example">}}
Quill is a Gnome Bard with the following stats:

<ul class="list-columns">
	<li><strong>STR:</strong> -1</li>
	<li><strong>DEX:</strong> +1</li>
	<li><strong>CON:</strong> +1</li>
	<li><strong>INT:</strong> 0</li>
	<li><strong>WIS:</strong> -1</li>
	<li><strong>CHA:</strong> +2</li>
</ul>

Based on these stats, he's very charismatic and quick on his feet, but he's not very strong. He has a low WIS score, so he's also pretty aloof and spacey.
{{</callout>}}

### 4. Pick your features

Every class starts with a handful of features, skills and traits that make you unique.

Classes that know magic&mdash;the Wizard, Druid, and Bard&mdash;also get to pick one or two additional _Advanced Features_ at the start.

You can also create your own _Ancestry Feature_. This is a feature that relates specifically to your chosen ancestry. A fairy might have the ability to fly short distances. A dragon might have a fire breathing feature. A gnome might be able to hide really well.

As you progress in the game, you'll pick up additional features that let you customize your character even more and give them new ways to play.

### 5. Pick your gear

Every adventurer needs gear.

In addition to unique features, every character starts the game with class-specific equipment. Bard's get an instrument. Fighters get to choose from an assortment of weapons. Wizards get a spellbook.

The character sheet includes a list of options for each class. You can also choose a personal trinket, something small and unique to your character. Totally optional.


## Rolling dice to learn what happens

For most player actions, what happens is decided by rolling a 20-sided die, called a D20.

To determine the outcome of an action, a player rolls a D20 and adds one of their stat modifiers based on what they're trying to do. The GM will tell you which stat to use.

| Roll | Outcome         | What it means                         |
|------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| 18+  | Success         | The player's action works as planned  |
| 9-17 | Partial Success | The players action works, with a cost |
| 8-   | Failure         | The player's action doesn't work      |

_**Don't have a D20?** [You can roll digital dice here.](https://www.wizards.com/dnd/dice/dice.htm)_

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
**The player is trying to convince a wealthy noble that they're a distance relative.** This is an act of deception. They roll a D20, and add their CHA stat.

- On 18 or above, the noble believes them, offering them a room in their palace and a feast in their honor.
- On a 9 to 17, the noble reluctantly believes them, but secretly sends someone to look into their background.
- On an 8 or less, the noble becomes angry, and has them arrested.

**The player is trying to run across a collapsing old bridge.** This requires dexterity. They roll a D20, and add their DEX stat.

- On an 18 or above, they run across and leap safely to the other side just as the bridge collapses.
- On a 9 to 17, they leap safely to the other side, but drop their weapon into the canyon.
- On an 8 or less, the bridge collapses under their feet.
{{</callout>}}



## Combat

Combat in Adventure works just like any other player action.

- The player says what they want to do, rolls a D20, and adds their modifier
- The GM describes what happens as a result

Attacks with a melee or up-close weapon (swords, axes, and such) use the STR stat. Ranged or far-away attacks (using a spear, bow, and so on) use the DEX stat. Similar, blocking uses STR, while dodging uses DEX.

{{<callout title="Examples">}}
**The player is trying to hit an ogre with their sword.** This is a feat of strength. They roll a D20, and add their STR stat.

- On 18 or above, the sword hits, causing the ogre to scream and stumble back a few feet.
- On a 9 to 17, the sword hits, but the ogre swings at them at the same time slams its fist into their shoulder.
- On an 8 or less, the sword misses, slamming into the ground beside the ogre.

**A troll throws a giant boulder at the player, and they attempt to jump out of the way.** This requires dexterity. They roll a D20, and add their DEX stat.

- On an 18 or above, the jump out of the way, and the boulder bounces off into the distance.
- On a 9 to 17, they leap out of the way, but the boulder catches their sword and knocks it 20 feet away.
- On an 8 or less, the boulder slams into them before they can jump out of the way.
{{</callout>}}

### Hit points

Every character and creature has a pool of _Hit Points_ (or _HP_). Hit Points represent a creatures overall health.

A characters _max HP_ is determined by adding their CON stat to a base number that varies by class (as indicated on their character sheet).

Whenever a character or creature takes damage, points are subtracted from their _current HP_. When their HP reaches 0, they're knocked out, and remain that way until another party member revives them.

_A character's current HP can never exceed their max HP._

{{<callout title="Example">}}
A rogue has a CON of +1. Their character sheet says their max HP is _6 + CON_, so their max HP is 7.

Their current HP starts at 7 as well. Then they get hit with an arrow and take 2 points of damage. Their current HP is now 5.
{{</callout>}}

### Calculating damage

Every character sheet specifies the _damage die_ used by that class.

Whenever your character successfully hits a creature, roll your damage die to determine how much damage is dealt.

Some weapons provide a _damage modifier_, additional damage dealt above what's rolled. For example, a warhammer deals _+1 damage_. When using it, you would add 1 to whatever number you roll.

{{<callout title="Example">}}
A fighter swings his warhammer, striking a goblin in the chest.

The fighter's damage die is a D10. They roll a 7, and the warhammer provides an additional +1 damage. The GM subtracts 8 from the goblin's HP.
{{</callout>}}

### Armor

Armor and shields provide protection against attacks.

When a character or creature receives damage while wearing armor, they subtract their _armor value_ from the damage received before subtracting it from their HP.

Most protective gear has an *n armor* rating. You can only wear one piece of armor of this type at a time.

Some protective gear, like shields, are additive and have a _+n armor_ rating. This can be added to whatever your current armor value is.

{{<callout title="Example">}}
The fighter is wearing chain mail (1 armor) and carrying a shield (+1).

A giant slams his club into the player, doing 5 points of damage. The player subtracts 3 from their current HP. The armor prevented 2 HP of damage.
{{</callout>}}



## Healing

As an adventurer, you're going to take damage from time-to-time. Fortunately, you can heal yourself in a variety of ways.

- During a _short rest_ (1 hour or less), you can recover one damage die roll of HP
- During a _long rest_ (8 hours or more), you recover all of your HP
- Using tools like bandages, an herbalism kit, or healing potion
