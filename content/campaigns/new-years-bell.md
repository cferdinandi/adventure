## Your Quest

On New Year's Eve, the residents of Farfaria have a huge party to celebrate the ringing of the New Year's Bell. The Bell's magical sound lulls the powerful ice dragons of the North into a deep sleep, and ushers an end to the cold winter months.

You're with your friends in the center of town, preparing for the night's festivities, when Mayor Remora Rockland comes running in, face red and sweat dripping down her forehead. She exclaims...

> The bell! It's been taken by the Balefrost, the powerful Ice Druid!

She rushes over to you and asks,

> Brave souls, can you help us retrieve the bell? If we don't ring it by midnight tonight, Farfaria will fall into an unending winter. Our crops won't grow, our rivers will freeze over, and we'll have no choice but to leave forever. You're our only hope.

She unrolls a map of Farfaria, and points to a spot in the Eastern Grove.

> My scouts followed the Balefrost here. There's a massive oak tree. The entrance to Balefrost's lair seems to be hidden somewhere near the base of the tree. Find it, make your way in, and locate the Bell.
>
> Once you do, get it back here as quickly as you can. Time is of the essence.

Two of Mayor Rockland's scouts step forward, and hand you supplies to help you on your journey.

As she walks out of the square, she turns back to you and says,

> Be careful. Balefrost is very powerful, and very dangerous. We're counting on you.
