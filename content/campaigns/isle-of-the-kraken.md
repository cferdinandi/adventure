Once every few years, a tiny island mysteriously rises from the depths of the sea for just a few hours. Itâ€™s rumored that a powerful wizard who hid his legendary Conch of Calling somewhere on the island several centuries ago.

You've been hired to venture to the island, retrieve the Conch, and deliver it to your benefactor. But beware! 

Many adventurers have journeyed the island over the years. None have returned...




## Campaign Details

Isle of the Kraken takes place in a medieval fantasy setting.

This is a short-term campaign with a fixed end. If the players are having fun, I'm happy to consider extending or continuing it.

- Sundays at 9:30pm US Eastern, every two weeks
- 2.5 hour long sessions (game runs to midnight each session)
- 3-5 sessions total
- Fully remote/online
- We'll be using [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scp-bFy4AqE) for maps, and Zoom or Discord for audio/video

I'll be prioritizing people I've interacted with regularly, new (to RPGs) players, and people from marginalized communities.



## Safety & Expectations

It's my job as a GM (game master) to keep all players safe.

Players are expected to be respectful of other people, and respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered. If you're having a problem and don't feel comfortable speaking up, please talk to me directly.

**This game may contain themes of** darkness, claustrophobia, creepy crawly monsters and insects, drowning, heights, forced captivity, and party-on-villain violence.

**If there are any specific topics or themes that you like to avoid** (including ones not listed above), please let me know. At you feel uncomfortable any point during the game, you can say, "pause for a second" and we will stop the game to address your concerns.


## How to Play

Adventure is a rules-light, story-focused roleplaying game (or RPG). You'll create a character to represent you on your adventure.

1. The Game Master (or GM, the person running the game) describes a situation.
2. The player or players state what they want to do.
3. The GM describes what happens.

Any time the result of an action is uncertain, you'll roll two 6-sided dice and add them resulting numbers together.

- On a 9 or higher, it works.
- On a 6-8, it works, but with a cost.
