Once every few years, a tiny island mysteriously rises from the depths of the sea for just a few hours. Legend holds that a long-dead wizard hid a creation known as the Conch of Calling there several centuries ago.

You've been hired to venture to the island, retrieve the Conch, and deliver it to your benefactor. But beware! 

Many adventurers have journeyed the island over the years. None have returned...

## Campaign Details

This is a short-term campaign, and new players are very welcome!

- Sessions at 9:30pm US Eastern, every two weeks (_we'll pick a day between Sunday through Thursday that works best for everyone_)
- 2.5 hour long sessions (_games run to midnight each session_)
- Approximately 3-5 sessions total
- 4 players maximum
- Fully remote/online
- We'll be using [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Scp-bFy4AqE) for maps, and Zoom or Discord for audio/video




## Creating a Character

Isle of the Kraken takes place in a medieval fantasy setting. 

The tone is gritty but whimsical. Think _the Witcher_, _Wheel of Time_, and _Shadow & Bone_ meet _Gummy Bears_ and _David the Gnome_.

- Your character can be small (_say around 1.5' tall_) to large (_up to 9' tall_)
- Talking animalfolk are allowed and encouraged (_example: bunnyfolk or owlfolk_)
- We'll discuss any special abilities or traits beforehand to make sure they're not overpowered. Powerful abilities may come with limits or tradeoffs.
- If you have any questions or need help, ask! I'm happy to help.




## How to Play

Adventure is a rules-light, story-focused roleplaying game (or RPG). You'll create a character to represent you on your adventure.

1. The Game Master (or GM, the person running the game) describes a situation.
2. The player or players state what they want to do.
3. The GM describes what happens.

Any time the result of an action is uncertain, you'll roll two 6-sided dice and add them resulting numbers together.

- On a 9 or higher, it works.
- On a 6-8, it works, but with a cost.
- On a 5 or lower, it fails.

## Safety & Expectations

It's my job as a GM (game master) to keep all players safe.

Players are expected to be respectful of other people, and respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered. If you're having a problem and don't feel comfortable speaking up, please talk to me directly.

**This game may contain themes of** darkness, claustrophobia, creepy crawly monsters and insects, drowning, heights, forced captivity, and party-on-villain violence.

**If there are any specific topics or themes that you like to avoid** (including ones not listed above), please let me know. At you feel uncomfortable any point during the game, you can say, "pause for a second" and we will stop the game to address your concerns.
