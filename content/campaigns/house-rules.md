Our young heroes are going to solve problems, escape dangerous situations, and work as a group. They will also occasionally fight monsters.

In my games, no one dies (not even the monsters), there's no blood, and the weapons are are more like toys (for example, arrows have suction cups). When monsters are defeated, the either run away or get knocked out, usually in a very funny, slapstick comedy way.

**If your young hero has any specific phobias or things I should avoid in the game, please let me know.** I want this to be a fun experience for everyone!


## How a Virtual Game Works

I'll be running this game over Zoom, and sharing maps and pictures of the places and creatures we encounter on our adventure.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>

1. I describe a situation.
2. The players tell me what they want to do.
3. I describes what happens.

{{<callout title="Example">}}
**GM:** "Before you lies a bridge. There are boards missing in places, and the ones that remain appear old and rotted. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to walk across, carefully checking for loose boards as I go."

**GM:** "As you're walking across, one of the boards starts to break under your feet. As you scramble across, the entire bridge begins to collapse. What do you do?"

**Player:** "I try to jump to the other side before the whole bridge falls down."

**GM:** "You push off the breaking board with all of your might, catching the ledge with your fingers and hoisting yourself over the edge. The bridge falls into the chasm below you. But as you do, your sword falls out of your hilt and drops onto a ledge about 20 feet down. What do you do?"
{{</callout>}}

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Before the game:</strong></p>

- Install Zoom, if it's not already on your computer
- Grab a six-sided die, a pencil, and a piece of paper

_If you think Zoom will cause issues on your computer or have concerns about it, please let me know and we can explore something else (like Google Meet)._

## Rules of the Table

To help keep things running smoothly, there are a few rules I'm going to ask the players to follow.

- Take turns doing things
- Don't interrupt when another player is talking
- Be kind to each other
- If you don't like something that's happening, let me know so I can change it
- Keep it G-rated (no bad language or excessive violence)

I don't like to restrict the players much, but I find having a few boundaries helps make the game more fun for everyone.


## What kinds of challenges and monsters will the heroes face?

It varies from game-to-game, but here's a representative sample of the kinds of challenges the heroes will have to overcome:

- Scaling high cliff faces
- Escaping from traps (nets, pits, and flooding rooms)
- Finding hidden items or solving riddles
- Figuring out how to cross dangerous terrain without getting hurt (like a wide chasm or a pool of lava)

And here are some of the monsters they may have to face:

- Giant Spiders
- Goblins
- Ogres
- Trolls
- Rock and Ice Monsters
- Dragons

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. I'm happy to adjust the adventure as needed.
