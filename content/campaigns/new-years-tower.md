## Your Quest

Every year on New Year's Eve, a mysterious tower appears on the hill overlooking the village four hours before midnight. When the New Year's Bell rings, ushering in the new year, a mist surrounds the tower, and it vanishes as quickly as it came.

It's rumored that Shadowhorn Kraghammer, a powerful wizard who lived several centuries ago, used to live there. It's also rumored that deep within the tower, Shadowhorn hid the _Sands of Time_, a magical hourglass of immense power.

For as long as anyone can remember, the villagers have been too afraid of the tower to enter it. But last year, three adventurers/siblings&mdash;Fawn, Heron, and Piper Stormcloud&mdash;decided to explore it. They were still in there when the New Year's Bell rang, and they haven't been seen since.

With just four hours until the New Year, the tower has again reappeared on the hill. Mayor Remora Rockland stands before you.

> Brave heroes, I'd like you to enter Shadowhorn Tower, find the Stormcloud Siblings, and return them to safety.
>
> Any treasure you find in the tower is yours to keep, but make sure you're out by midnight, or you'll be trapped in there for who knows how long.

Reaching into the bag on her shoulder, Mayor Rockland hands you supplies for your rescue mission.

As you leave her office, she calls out to you...

> Be careful. No one knows what mysteries the tower holds.
