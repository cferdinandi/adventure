You live in the town of Farfaria, a tiny little village nestled between mountains, sweeping forests, and a deep and mysterious ocean. Mysterious and exciting adventures always seem to find their way to your little village, where you and your friends are ready to help.

Every year on New Year’s Eve, a mysterious tower appears, only to disappear four hours later. Last year, three adventurers entered the tower, never to be seen again.

Can you rescue them—and make it back out—before midnight, when the tower disappears again?
