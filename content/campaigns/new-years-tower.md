You live in the town of Farfaria, a tiny little village nestled between mountains, sweeping forests, and a deep and mysterious ocean. Mysterious and exciting adventures always seem to find their way to your little village, where you and your friends are ready to help.

Every year on New Year’s Eve, a mysterious tower appears, only to disappear four hours later. Last year, three adventurers entered the tower, never to be seen again.

Can you rescue them—and make it back out—before midnight, when the tower disappears again?

## Character Ideas

Do you know magic? Are you brave warrior? A musician who inspires your friends? A stealthy ninja? Are you human, or a mythical creature like a dragon or fairy or elf?

(_You don't need a lot of detail around your character, just a basic concept. We'll work out the details at the start of the game._)

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>If you know magic,</strong> what are two or three spells you know? Here are a few ideas to get you started (<em>don't take them all, you'll pick up more as you play</em>).</p>

- **Magic Missiles.** A blast of magic energy shoots from your hands.
- **Wave of Thunder.** A wave of sound shoots out from you, pushing everyone near you 15’ back.
- **Sleep.** Make one large monster, two medium ones, or four small ones fall asleep.
- **Illusion.** You create a small illusory sight or sound that lasts for about a minute.
- **Heal.** Heal a creature you can touch.
- **Tangle of Vines.** A tangle of vines 15’ wide grows and restrains any creatures in the&nbsp;area.
- **Speak with Nature.** Place your hands on an animal, plant, body of water, stone, or other natural element and learn about recent events from it.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>If you're feeling stuck,</strong> here are a few ideas to help you get started.</p>

- **Elf Wizard.** You can speak to animals and see in the dark. You can cast the _Magic Missiles_ and _Sleep_ spells.
- **Fairy Druid.** You can fly and turn into small animals. You can cast the _Heal_ and _Tangle of Vines_ spells.
- **Bear Barbarian.** You're big and strong, and monsters tend to be scared of you. You carry a big wooden hammer.
- **Human Knight.** You're a brave, skilled fighter who loves to defend the powerless. Your suit of armor keeps you extra safe.
- **Octopus Pirate.** You're incredibly lucky and always land on one of your eight feet. You can squeeze into the tiniest of spaces.
