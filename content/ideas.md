## Creature Types

Some ideas for different types of creatures, and some natural abilities they might have. These are just ideas, so feel free to adapt them as you see fit.

- **Elves.** Able to talk to animals and see in the dark. Heal 3HP and turn invisible in full moonlight. Heal 1HP in half-moonlight.
- **Halflings.** Small size grants advantage while hiding and moving stealthily. Possess magical luck that let's you reroll one failed roll a day.
- **Dwarves.** Can see in the dark. Able to talk to rocks and stones. Immune to toxins.
- **Gnomes.** Able to talk to animals. Small size grants advantage while hiding and moving stealthily.
- **Dragonfolk.** Can breathe fire. Thick scales protect you from piercing damage and fire.
- **Giants.** Large size grants advantage on strength-based tasks. Can easily intimidate others.
- **Frogfolk.** Can breath underwater, climb vertical surfaces with ease, and jump very far.
- **Lizardfolk.** An hour of sunlight heals you 1HP. Can easily climb vertical surfaces. Can easily find hiding spots.
- **Birdfolk.** Can fly short distances and balance with ease. Sharp beak and talons are natural weapons. Keen eyesight.
- **Slime.** Can alter your shape and fit into tight spaces. Piercing attacks don't effect, but slashing and fire do twice as much damage.
