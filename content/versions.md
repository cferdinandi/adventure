*Adventure* is currently in version 3.

- [Version 1](/v1)
- [Version 2](/v2)

## What's new in version 3?

- Switched from D6 to polyhedral dice, with a D20 for primary rolls.
- Switched to six core stats, the same as those used in _D&D_ and _Dungeon World_.
- Updated the die roll mechanic to use a single die roll with modifiers instead of multiple dice. This provides a more balanced and varied set of outcomes.
- Changed how combat works to provide a more immersive and cinematic experience. The _Game Master_ no longer rolls a die. All outcomes are determined by player rolls.
- Completely overhauled player leveling and progression. Players now choose from a handful of classes, and get to pick up new pre-defined features as they level. There's flexibility to homebrew features, but the added structure makes playing easier and more balanced for newer players.
- Improved creature creation rules make it easy to spin up custom monsters and NPCs on-the-fly.
