<p>Here's an intro you can use if you need help getting started.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>You live in the land of Farfaria, in a tiny little village nestled between a mountain range and a sweeping forest.</p>
	<p>Rivers flow down from the mountains, cut through your village, and run through the forest, where they eventually connect with the ocean.</p>
	<p>While Farfaria is a small and remote town, you're hardly alone. The woods and mountains are filled with amazing, magical creatures: elves, fairies, centaurs, and wizards. They're filled with dangerous creatures&mdash;thieves, giants, and ogres&mdash;too. The ocean to the south is home to mermaids, krakens, and other monsters of the&nbsp;deep.</p>
	<p>Mysterious and exciting adventures always seem to find their way to your little village, where you and your friends are ready to help...</p>
